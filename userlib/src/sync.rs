/// a time. This can be used to put mutable data in a `static` safely.
///
/// In our system, this plays two roles:
///
/// 1. It convinces the compiler to let us put non-`Sync` data in a `static`. We
///    are single threaded, but the compiler does not understand that.
///
/// 2. It catches mistakes like reentrant access to the `static`, which could
///    violate aliasing rules even in a single-threaded environment.
///
/// # Consider whether you need this.
///
/// Even with controlled access, a global is still a global. This type is only
/// appropriate for cases where you genuinely want something to be global
/// (diagnostic ringbuffers are the canonical example). In most cases, if you
/// want static mutable data, you'd be better off with `singleton`.
///
/// # Reentrant access is a programming error.
///
/// This is a lot like a mutex, but it is more like a `RefCell` in practice,
/// because if code tries to access it twice, it panics instead of trying to
/// block. By using this type, you're saying that any attempt to get two
/// references to the contents simultaneously would indicate an error in your
/// program. This is usually what you want with a mutable `static`.
///
/// Note that this type does not provide any sort of read-write-lock facility.
/// It could be extended to do this, but we haven't needed it yet.
