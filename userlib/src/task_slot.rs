// static PeerTask.  Further, for_peer_task() is only intended to be used by
// peer_task!() which places the PeerTaskTableEntry in a .peer_task_table linker
// section that is treated similar to debug information in that no virtual
// addresses are allocated to the contents and the section is not loaded into
// the process space.  As such, instances of PeerTaskTableEntry will never exist
// at runtime.
