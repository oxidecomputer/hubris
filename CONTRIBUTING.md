# Hubris project status and open source

The Hubris repo (and associated repos) is public because

1. It has always been our intention to make this open-source.
2. We figured it's best to err on the side of doing this early instead of late.

However, Hubris is not done, or even ready. It's probably not a good fit for
your use case, because it's not yet a good fit for _our_ use case!

And so, we thought it was important to explain where we're currently at, and
manage your expectations.

- We are a small company.

- Our current goal is to get our first generation products finished and in
  customers' hands.

- We're writing Hubris in support of that goal, not as its own thing. Hubris has
  a total of zero full time engineers -- we're all working on the products, and
  tool development is a side effect.

- For expediency, we're developing our server firmware and Hubris in the same
  repo. We will probably split this up later to make it more obvious how to use
  Hubris from other applications. But, for now, we're primarily focused on
  getting _our_ firmware ready, because, again, we need to finish our computers.

- These points together mean that we may not have enough bandwidth to review and
  integrate outside PRs right now. This will change in the future.

You're welcome to send PRs! If we have time, or if the PRs are very small or fix
bugs, we may even integrate them in the near future. But be aware that we might
not get to it for a while, by which time it might no longer be relevant.

We've all dealt with those open source projects that feel open in name only, and
have big patches and history-free source drops appearing from behind the walls
of some large organization. We don't like that, and we're not going to do that.
But please bear with us while we're scaling up.

If you want to ask about whether a PR is consistent with our short-term plan
_before_ you put in the work -- and you should! -- hit us up on the repo
Discussions tab on GitHub.

Thanks!
