# STM32G0 System Tests

This tests the kernel (not drivers!) on the STM32G0, to exercise Cortex-M0
support.

Cortex-M0 parts don't have ITM, so the conventional `humility test` won't work.
Instead, you want to run this under OpenOCD with semihosting enabled. The
easiest way to do this is by

- Run `cargo xtask humility test/tests-stm32g0/app-g070.toml -- openocd`
- In a separate terminal, run `cargo xtask gdb test/tests-stm32g0/app-g070.toml`
- Delete breakpoints in GDB: `d`
- Run: `c`
- The output should appear in the OpenOCD terminal
