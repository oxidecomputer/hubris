# STM32G0 System Tests

This tests the kernel (not drivers!) on the STM32G0, to exercise Cortex-M0
support.

Cortex-M0 parts don't have ITM, so the conventional `humility test` won't work.
Instead, you want to run this under openocd with semihosting enabled. The
easiest way to do this is by

- Running `openocd` from the `app/demo-stm32g0-nucleo` directory to pick up the
  right config
- In a separate terminal, run `cargo xtask gdb test/tests-stm32g0/app-g070.toml
  app/demo-stm32g0-nucleo/openocd.gdb`
- Delete breakpoints in GDB: `d`
- Run: `c`
