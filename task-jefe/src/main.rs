//! Implementation of the system supervisor.
//!
//! The supervisor is responsible for:
//!
//! - Maintaining the system console output (currently via semihosting).
//! - Monitoring tasks for failures and restarting them.
//!
//! It will probably become responsible for:
//!
//! - Evacuating kernel log information.
//! - Coordinating certain shared resources, such as the RCC and GPIO muxing.
//! - Managing a watchdog timer.
//!
//! It's unwise for the supervisor to use `SEND`, ever, except to talk to the
//! kernel. This is because a `SEND` to a misbehaving task could block forever,
//! taking out the supervisor. The long-term idea is to provide some sort of
//! asynchronous messaging from the supervisor to less-trusted tasks, but that
//! doesn't exist yet, so we're mostly using RECV/REPLY and notifications. This
//! means that hardware drivers required for this task must be built in instead
//! of running in separate tasks.
