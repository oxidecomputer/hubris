// TODO Currently we only have one implementor of this trait
// (`HostFlashUpdate`), and we don't actually use the trait directly anywhere.
// This is currently just a guide for how we expect component update
// implementations to be structured; once we have more than one, we can adjust
// this trait definition and/or see if it makes sense to have some generic
// support code.
//
// `SpUpdate` has methods with similar names/signatures, but aren't quite the
// same due to having to deal with both auxflash and SP images. It therefore
// does not implement this trait. That's another wart that we might be able to
// address once we start adding more implementors and tweak this trait.
