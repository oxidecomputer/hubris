//! External interface for Jefe
//!
//! It can be very handy to have Jefe be externally influenced by a debugger.
//! This allows tasks to be remotely controlled at some level:  they can be
//! held on a fault, started (when stopped), etc.  The interface for this
//! relies on variables at well-known locations; the debugger knows to find
//! these locations and modify them.
//!
//! But wait, you might well exclaim: doesn't Hubris already have an external
//! debugger interface in HIF that could be used for this?  And wouldn't it
//! really be much more elegant to have Jefe have an interface to set task
//! restart disposition, and then have Humility use its HIF mechanisms to call
//! it?  Indeed, this is so tantalizing that this interface was in fact
//! reimplemented exactly that way -- only to discover some unintended
//! consequences.  First, the task that executes HIF needs to be the lowest
//! priority task in the system to allow it to call other, high priority tasks
//! (thereby avoiding inversion) -- but by dint of being the lowest priority,
//! it can be starved by essentially every other task.  This becomes
//! problematic when a high priority task is in a fault loop, as it becomes
//! impossible for the HIF execution engine to actually get scheduled to
//! tell Jefe to stop restarting the faulting task.  This is frustrating for
//! the user:  they are (correctly) trying to tell Jefe to hold the faulting
//! task, and they will be greeted with nothing but execution timeouts.
//!
//! And if that weren't enough, having Jefe's restart disposition set via HIF
//! execution introduces another thorny problem: if the HIF execution is
//! itself inducing a panic in a server that it is calling (as it may well in
//! development), it is natural to want to hold that task on the fault.  Once
//! the task is held, the HIF execution engine will be held too (as it is its
//! call that is inducing the fault).  There is nothing wrong with that --
//! until it comes time to unhold the task.  Under these conditions, the
//! system is wedged:  the HIF task cannot execute (it is reply-blocked) to
//! tell Jefe to restart the faulted task.
//!
//! These problems were a clear message from the gods: we were being punished
//! for the hubris of a meaningless elegance.  Seeing the folly of our mortal
//! ways, we restored the logic you see before you -- but added this
//! additional warning, surely fated to become half sunk in the lone and level
//! sands...
//!
