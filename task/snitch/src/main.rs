//! the snitch: ereport evacuation
//!
//! The snitch is the component of the ereport subsystem responsible for
//! evacuating ereports over the network, as described in [RFD 545 ยง 4.4]. The
//! snitch task does not store ereports in its memory; this is `packrat`'s
//! responsibility. Instead, the snitch's role is to receive requests for
//! ereports over the management network, read them from packrat, and forward
//! them to the requesting management gateway.
//!
//! This split is necessary because, in order to communicate over the management
//! network, the snitch must run at a relatively low priority: in particular, it
//! must be lower than that of the `net` task, of which it is a client. Since we
//! would like a variety of tasks to be able to *report* errors through the
//! ereport subsystem, the task responsible for aggregating ereports in memory
//! must run at a high priority, so that as many other tasks as possible may act
//! as clients of it. Furthermore, we would like to include the SP's VPD
//! identity in ereport messages, and this is already stored in packrat.
//! Therefore, we separate the responsibility for storing ereports from the
//! responsibility for sending them over the network.
//!
//! Due to this separation of responsibilities, the snitch task is fairly
//! simple. It receives packets sent to the ereport socket, interprets the
//! request message, and forwards the request to packrat. Any ereports sent back
//! by packrat are sent in response to the request. The snitch ends up being a
//! pretty dumb proxy: as the response packet is encoded by packrat; all we end
//! up doing is taking the bytes received from packrat and stuffing them into
//! the socket's send queue. The real purpose of this thing is just to serve as
//! a trampoline between the high priority level of packrat and a priority level
//! lower than that of the net task.
