//! Ring buffer for debugging Hubris tasks and drivers
//!
//! This contains an implementation for a static ring buffer designed to be used
//! to instrument arbitrary contexts.  While there is nothing to prevent these
//! ring buffers from being left in production code, the design center is
//! primarily around debugging in development: the ring buffers themselves can
//! be processed either with Humility (which has built-in support via the
//! `humility ringbuf` command) or via GDB.
//!
//! ## Constraints
//!
//! The main constraint for a ring buffer is that the type in the ring buffer
//! must implement [`Copy`]. If [de-duplication](#entry-de-duplication) is
//! enabled, the entry type must also implement [`PartialEq`]. When using the
//! [`counted_ringbuf!`] macro to [count ring buffer
//! entries](#counted-ring-buffers), the entry type must implement the
//! [`counters::Count`] trait.
//!
//! If you use the variants of the `ringbuf!` macro that leave the name of the
//! data structure implicit, you can only have one per module. (You can lift
//! this constraint by providing a name.)
//!
//! ## Creating a ring buffer
//!
//! Ring buffers are instantiated with the [`ringbuf!`] macro, to which one
//! must provide the type of per-entry payload, the number of entries, and a
//! static initializer.  For example, to define a 16-entry ring buffer with
//! each entry containing a [`core::u32`].
//!
//! ```
//! ringbuf!(u32, 16, 0);
//! ```
//!
//! Ring buffer entries are generated with [`ringbuf_entry!`] specifying a
//! payload of the appropriate type, e.g.:
//!
//! ```
//! ringbuf_entry!(isr.bits());
//! ```
//!
//! You can also provide a name for the ring buffer, to distinguish between them
//! if you have more than one:
//!
//! ```
//! ringbuf!(MY_RINGBUF, u32, 16, 0);
//!
//! // ...
//!
//! ringbuf_entry!(MY_RINGBUF, isr.bits());
//! ```
//!
//! Payloads can obviously be more sophisticated; for example, here's a payload
//! that takes a floating point value and an optional register:
//!
//! ```
//! ringbuf!((f32, Option<Register>), 128, (0.0, None));
//! ```
//!
//! For which one might add an entry with (say):
//!
//! ```
//! ringbuf_entry!((temp, Some(Register::TempMSB)));
//! ```
//!
//! ### Counted ring buffers
//!
//! One limitation of ring buffers for recording diagnostic data is that, when a
//! very large number of entries have been recorded, historical data may not be
//! available, as the earliest entries may have have "fallen off" the end of the
//! ring buffer and been overwritten. Therefore, to preserve historical data in
//! ring buffers that record a large number of events, or where the size of the
//! ring buffer is small, this crate also provides a [`counted_ringbuf!] macro.
//!
//! The [`counted_ringbuf!`] macro is used to declare a ring buffer that records
//! a total count of each entry variant that has been recorded, in addition to
//! storing the last `N` entries. This way, some information about entries that
//! have been overwritten is still preserved, making it possible to determine
//! whether an entry variant has *ever* been recorded, even if it has been
//! overwritten. The data recorded by counters is less granular than the ringbuf
//! itself, as entry variants that hold data are collapsed into a single
//! counter, regardless of their field values, and the order in which entries
//! have occurred is not preserved by a counter.
//!
//! Entry variant counts are recorded even when this crate is compiled with the
//! "disabled" feature flag set. This allows targets which lack the memory for
//! an entire ring buffer to still record event counts. To disable counting ring
//! buffer entries, set the "counters-disabled" feature flag. This feature may
//! be set independently of the "disabled" feature: if both are set, neither
//! ring buffer entries nor counters will be recorded; if *only*
//! "counters-disabled" is set, the [`counted_ringbuf!`] macro will behave
//! identically to the [`ringbuf!`] macro, recording ringbuf entries but not
//! counters.
//!
//! To use the [`counted_ringbuf!`] macro, the entry type must be
//! an `enum`, and it must implement the [`counters::Count`] trait, which
//! defines a mechanism for counting occurences of each entry variant.
//! Typically, the [`Count`] trait is implemented using the `#[derive(Count)]`
//! attribute. The same [`ringbuf_entry!`] and [`ringbuf_entry_root!`] macros
//! can be used to record an entry in a counted ring buffer.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! ```
//! // Declare an enum type and derive the `Count` trait for it:
//! #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, counters::Count)]
//! pub enum MyEvent {
//!     NothingHappened,
//!     SomethingHappened,
//!     SomethingElseHappened(u32),
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! // Declare a counted ring buffer of `MyEvent` entries:
//! counted_ringbuf!(MyEvent, 16, MyEvent::NothingHappened);
//!
//! // Record an entry in the counted ring buffer, incrementing the counter
//! // for the `MyEvent::SomethingHappened` variant:
//! ringbuf_entry!(MyEvent::SomethingHappened);
//!
//! // Record an entry variant with data. Note that both of these entries will
//! // increment the *same* counter (`SomethingElseHappened`), despite having
//! // different values:
//! ringbuf_entry!(MyEvent::SomethingElseHappened(42));
//! ringbuf_entry!(MyEvent::SomethingElseHappened(666));
//! ```
//!
//! ### Entry de-duplication
//!
//! By default, when the same value is recorded in a ring buffer multiple times
//! in a row, the subsequent entries are recorded by incrementing a counter
//! stored in the initial entry, rather than by adding new entries to the
//! ringbuf. This de-duplication prevents the ring buffer from filling up with a
//! large number of duplicate entries, allowing the earlier history to be
//! recorded.
//!
//! However, this de-duplication requires the entry type to implement the
//! [`PartialEq`] trait, and performs a comparison with the previous entry
//! whenever an entry is recorded. The [`PartialEq`] implementation and
//! comparisons can have a meaningful impact on binary size, especially when the
//! entry type is complex. Therefore, code which does not record a large number
//! of duplicate entries, or which does not care about de-duplicating them, can
//! disable de-duplication by adding the `no_dedup` argument at the end of the
//! [`ringbuf!`] or [`counted_ringbuf!`] macro. For example:
//!
//! ```
//! ringbuf!(u32, 16, 0, no_dedup);
//! ```
//!
//! Or, with [`counted_ringbuf!`]:
//!
//! ````
//! #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, counters::Count)]
//! pub enum MyEvent {
//!     NothingHappened,
//!     SomethingHappened,
//!     SomethingElseHappened(u32),
//!     // ...
//! }
//! counted_ringbuf!(MyEvent, 16, MyEvent::NothingHappened, no_dedup);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Inspecting a ring buffer via Humility
//!
//! Humility has built-in support for dumping a ring buffer, and will (by
//! default) look for and dump any ring buffer declared with [`ringbuf!`], e.g.:
//!
//! ```console
//! $ cargo xtask humility app.toml ringbuf
//! humility: attached via ST-Link
//! humility: ring buffer MAX31790_RINGBUF in thermal:
//! ADDR        NDX LINE  GEN    COUNT PAYLOAD
//! 0x20007774    1  242   12        1 (Some(Tach5CountMSB), Ok([ 0xff, 0xe0 ]))
//! 0x20007788    2  242   12        1 (Some(Tach6CountMSB), Ok([ 0xff, 0xe0 ]))
//! 0x2000779c    3  242   12        1 (Some(Tach1CountMSB), Ok([ 0x7d, 0xc0 ]))
//! 0x200077b0    4  242   12        1 (Some(Tach2CountMSB), Ok([ 0xff, 0xe0 ]))
//! 0x200077c4    5  242   12        1 (Some(Tach3CountMSB), Ok([ 0xff, 0xe0 ]))
//! 0x200077d8    6  242   12        1 (Some(Tach4CountMSB), Ok([ 0xff, 0xe0 ]))
//! 0x200077ec    7  242   12        1 (Some(Tach5CountMSB), Ok([ 0xff, 0xe0 ]))
//! 0x20007800    8  242   12        1 (Some(Tach6CountMSB), Ok([ 0xff, 0xe0 ]))
//! 0x20007814    9  242   12        1 (Some(Tach1CountMSB), Ok([ 0x7d, 0xe0 ]))
//! ...
//! ```
//!
//! You can also dump a particular ring buffer by giving its name.
//!
//! If for any reason a raw view is needed, one can also use `humility readvar`
//! and specify the corresponding `RINGBUF` variable.  (The name of the
//! variable is `RINGBUF` prefixed with the stem of the file that declared
//! it.)
//!
//! ## Inspecting a ring buffer via GDB
//!
//! Assuming symbols are loaded, one can use GDB's `print` command,
//! specifying the crate that contains the ring buffer and the appropraite
//! `RINGBUF` variable.  If the `thermal` task defines a ring buffer in
//! its main, it can be printed this way:
//!
//! ```console
//! (gdb) set print pretty on
//! (gdb) print task_thermal::RINGBUF
//!
//! $2 = task_thermal::Ringbuf<core::option::Option<drv_i2c_devices::max31790::Fan>> {
//!  last: core::option::Option<usize>::Some(3),
//!  buffer: [
//!    task_thermal::RingbufEntry<core::option::Option<drv_i2c_devices::max31790::Fan>> {
//!      line: 31,
//!      generation: 9,
//!      count: 1,
//!      payload: core::option::Option<drv_i2c_devices::max31790::Fan>::Some(drv_i2c_devices::max31790::Fan (
//!          3
//!        ))
//!    },...
//! ```
//!
//! To inspect a ring buffer that is in a dependency, the full crate will need
//! to be specified, e.g. to inspect a ring buffer that is used in the `max31790`
//! module of the `drv_i2c_devices` crate:
//!
//! ```console
//! (gdb) set print pretty on
//! (gdb) print drv_i2c_devices::max31790::MAX31790_RINGBUF
//! $3 = drv_i2c_devices::max31790::Ringbuf<(core::option::Option<drv_i2c_devices::max31790::Register>, core::result::Result<[u8; 2], drv_i2c_api::ResponseCode>)> {
//!  last: core::option::Option<usize>::Some(30),
//!  buffer: [
//!    drv_i2c_devices::max31790::RingbufEntry<(core::option::Option<drv_i2c_devices::max31790::Register>, core::result::Result<[u8; 2], drv_i2c_api::ResponseCode>)> {
//!      line: 242,
//!      generation: 79,
//!      count: 1,
//!      payload: (
//!        core::option::Option<drv_i2c_devices::max31790::Register>::Some(drv_i2c_devices::max31790::Register::Tach6CountMSB),
//!        core::result::Result<[u8; 2], drv_i2c_api::ResponseCode>::Err(0)
//!      )
//!    },...
//! ```
