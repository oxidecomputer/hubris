//! CBOR encoding traits with statically known maximum lengths.
//!
//! This crate provides traits and derive macros for encoding Rust types as
//! CBOR, with the maximum encoded length of the CBOR data determined at compile
//! time. This allows for the maximum buffer size needed to encode the data to
//! be determined at compile-time, allowing static allocation of encoding
//! buffers without the possibility of encoding failures due to insufficient
//! buffer space.
//!
//! When encoding ereports in Hubris, the CBOR messages are generally simple and
//! consist of fixed-size data. However, if buffer sizes for encoding are just
//! chosen arbitrarily by the programmer, it is possible that subsequent changes
//! to the ereport messages will increase the encoded size beyond the chosen
//! buffer size, leading to encoding failures and data loss. Thus, this crate.
//!
//! This crate provides the [`StaticCborLen`] trait for types that can be
//! encoded as CBOR with a known maximum encoded length. In addition, it
//! provides [`#[derive(Encode)`](macro@Encode) and
//! [`#[derive(EncodeFields)`](macro@EncodeFields) derive attributes for
//! deriving implementations of the [`Encode`] and [`StaticCborLen`] traits.
//!
//! ## Wait, Why Not `#[derive(serde::Serialize)]`?
//!
//! Well, the obvious one is that there's no way to know how many bytes a given
//! type's `Serialize` implementation will produce at compile-time.
//!
//! Another limitation, though, is that `serde`'s `#[serde(flatten)]` attribute
//! requires `liballoc`, as the flattened fields are temporarily stored on the
//! heap while encoding. This means that `#[serde(flatten)]` cannot be used to
//! compose nested structs in Hubris ereport messages. By introducing a separate
//! [`EncodeFields`] trait that encodes the fields of a type into a "parent"
//! struct or struct-like enum variant, we avoid this limitation and allow
//! composition of ereport messages.
//!
//! ## Okay, What About `#[derive(minicbor::Encode)]`?
//!
//! `minicbor` also has a first-party derive macro crate, [`minicbor-derive`].
//! Would that be suitable for our purposes? Unfortunately, no.
//! `minicbor-derive` takes a very opinionated approach to CBOR encoding, with
//! the intention of providing forward- and backward-compatibility using a
//! technique similar to the one used by Protocol Buffers`. When using
//! `minicbor-derive`, fields must be annotated with index numbers (like those
//! of protobuf), and fields are serialized with those index numbers as their
//! keys, rather than their actual Rust identifiers.
//!
//! While this scheme is useful in some situations, it doesn't satisfy the goals
//! of the ereport subsystem. The whole reason we are using CBOR in the first
//! place is that we would like to allow decoding key-value data without having
//! to know the structure of the data in advance. `minicbor-derive`'s scheme
//! requires both sides of the exchange to know what field names those index
//! numbers map to at *some* version of the protocol, even if newer versions are
//! backwards compatible. So, it's unsuitable for our purposes.
//!
//! `minicbor-derive` also lacks a way to determine the maximum needed buffer
//! length to encode a value at compile time, which is this crate's primary
//! reason to exist.
//!
