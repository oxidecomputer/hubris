# Hubris

[![build](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild)

Hubris is a microcontroller operating environment designed for deeply-embedded
systems with reliability requirements. Its design was initially proposed in
RFD41, but has evolved considerably since then.

# Learning

We have some documentation in disjointed files in the `doc/` directory. This
file gives quick-start information.

# Developing

We currently support Linux and Windows as first-tier platforms. The build
probably also works on Illumos and Mac; if anyone would like to step up to
maintain support and a continuous build for those architectures, we'd love the
help.

To submit changes for review, push them to a new branch in this repo (_not_ a
separate GitHub fork) and submit a pull request to merge that branch into
master.  (Pull requests from separate GitHub forks do not currently work.
First, the pre-integration checks do not get run automatically in forks, so
you'd have to enable Actions in your fork.  More importantly, these checks
require configuration of a repository secret in order to clone private
submodules, so they'll fail when run from a fork.)

## Prereqs

You will need:

- The nightly toolchain. (It will *probably* automatically install when you try
  to build, but people have had issues.)

- `openocd` (mostly tested on 0.10) or (if using the LPC55)
  `pyocd` (0.27 or later).  Note that the 0.10 release of OpenOCD predates the
  STLink v3.  People are using various post-0.10 builds provided by system
  package managers.  If you're going to use Homebrew on macOS to install
  OpenOCD, you need to use `brew install --head openocd` to build the tip of the
  main branch rather than using the latest binary release.

- The appropriate Rust toolchain target installed: (if your toolchain installed
  automatically, this will too)
  - `rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf` (for the STM32)
  - `rustup target add thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf` (for the LPC55)

- [libusb](https://libusb.info/), typically found from your system's package
  manager as `libusb-1.0.0` or similar.

- [libfdti1](https://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/), found
  as `libftdi1-dev` or similar.

- `arm-none-eabi-objcopy` and `arm-none-eabi-gdb`, typically from your system's
  package manager using package names like `arm-none-eabi-binutils` and
  `arm-none-eabi-gdb`.  macOS users might check out
  [homebrew-arm](https://github.com/osx-cross/homebrew-arm), a Homebrew repo
  with formulae that install the official ARM binaries.

- The Hubris debugger, [Humility](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/humility):
  - `cargo install --git ssh://git@github.com/oxidecomputer/humility.git`

### Windows

If you're on Windows, you can get set up by doing this:

See [here](http://openocd.org/getting-openocd/) for getting the source of `openocd`
or get unofficial binaries. Alternatively, you can install via
with [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install):

```console
> choco install openocd
```

You can easily install `openocd` with [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```console
> scoop bucket add extras
> scoop install openocd
```
NOTE: `openocd` installed via `scoop` has proven problematic for some users. If
you experience problems, try installing via `choco` or from source (see above).

You'll probably need to install [this
driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).

If your terminal doesn't support serial connections, you'll want to also use
PuTTY; [this guide](https://pbxbook.com/voip/sputty.html) does a good job of
explaining how.

Finally, the instructions below invoke shell scripts. They're very small, and
so for now you can run the commands manually, yourself. We may improve this
in the future.

## Build

**We do not use `cargo build` or `cargo run` directly because they are too
inflexible for our purposes.** We have a complex multi-architecture build, which
is a bit beyond them.

Instead, the repo includes a Cargo extension called `xtask` that namespaces our
custom build commands.

- `cargo xtask dist TOMLFILE` builds a distribution image for the
  application described by the TOML file.
  - `cargo xtask dist demo/app.toml` - stm32f4-discovery
  - `cargo xtask dist demo/app-f3.toml` - stm32f3-discovery
  - `cargo xtask dist lpc55/app.toml` - lpcxpresso55s69
  - `cargo xtask dist demo-stm32h7/app-h743.toml` - nucleo-ih743zi2
  - `cargo xtask dist demo-stm32h7/app-h7b3.toml` - stm32h7b3i-dk
  - `cargo xtask dist gemini-bu/app.toml` - Gemini bringup board
- `cargo xtask build` from within a task or kernel directory builds that one
  component in isolation. **The result won't actually run,** because it's
  missing important system context, but this provides a cheaper way to do
  incremental builds during development. See the `Iterating` section below.

Note: Because the Hubris repository contains submodules, before building, you
must update submodules, either via `git clone --recursive`, or
`git submodule update --init` or similar.

## Run

Details depend on your target board. Here are some common evaluation boards we
support.

### Gemini bringup board

See the Gemini Bringup [Getting
Started](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/gemini-bringup#getting-started) docs.

### STM32F3 & STM32F4 Discovery boards

Connect board via USB.

From one terminal, launch `openocd` with the corresponding config file:

```console
$ openocd -f demo/openocd.cfg       # STM32F4 Discovery boards OR
$ openocd -f demo/openocd-f3.cfg    # STM32F3 Discovery boards
```

From another terminal:

```console
$ cargo xtask gdb demo/app.toml openocd.gdb         # STM32F4 Discovery boards OR
$ cargo xtask gdb demo/app-f3.toml openocd-f3.gdb   # STM32F3 Discovery boards
```

If this works, you'll see `gdb` mumble some things about flashing, `openocd`
will scroll by some updates, and you will eventually be unceremoniously
deposited at a `(gdb)` prompt halted on the first instruction. Type `c` /
`continue` to run.

**Note that for the STM32F3 Discovery, SB10 must be soldered closed for ITM
to work!** This solder bridge defaults to being open, which leaves SWO
disconnected.  See the STM32F3 Discovery User Manual (UM1570) for schematic
and details.

### LPCXpresso55S69 board

To use the LPCXpresso55S69, you will need [pyOCD](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD), version 0.27.0 or later.

The LPCXpresso55S69 is somewhat of a mess because the built-on on-chip
debugger, LPC-Link2, [does not correctly support SWO/SWV](https://community.nxp.com/t5/LPC-Microcontrollers/SWO-SWV-on-LPC-Link2-with-CMSIS-DAP/m-p/1079442)

If you have the stock LPC-Link2, it will report itself this way via `pyocd list`:


```console
$ pyocd list
  #   Probe                                           Unique ID
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  0   NXP Semiconductors LPC-LINK2 CMSIS-DAP V5.361   JSAQCQIQ
```

It's also possible that you have the Segger J-Link firmware -- firmware
that will make its odious presence known by prompting for you to accept license
terms whenever running `pyocd list`!

```console
$ pyocd list
  #   Probe                                                       Unique ID
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0   Segger J-Link LPCXpresso V2 compiled Apr  4 2019 16:54:03   726424936
```

In either of these cases you must -- as a one-time step -- install new
firmware on the LPC-Link2.  The new firmware is a build of the (open source) 
[DAPLink](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/DAPLink), which
we affectionally call **RickLink** after
the engineer who managed to get it all built -- no small feat!

There are two files that you will need, both contained in the Hubris repository:

- [lpc4322_bl_crc.bin](./support/lpc4322_bl_crc.bin)
- [lpc4322_lpc55s69xpresso_if_rla_swo_hacks.bin](./support/lpc4322_lpc55s69xpresso_if_rla_swo_hacks.bin)

You will additionally need the [LPCScrypt program](https://www.nxp.com/design/microcontrollers-developer-resources/lpc-microcontroller-utilities/lpcscrypt-v2-1-1:LPCSCRYPT)
from NXP.

Here are the steps to install RickLink:

1. Install the DFU jumper. This can be found next to the SWD header on the
left side of the board; it is labelled "DFU".

2. Run `scripts/boot_lpcscrypt` from the installed LPCScrypt software:

```console
$ /usr/local/lpcscrypt/scripts/boot_lpcscrypt 
Looking for DFU devices with VID 1fc9 PID 000c ...
dfu-util -d 1fc9:000c -c 1 -i 0 -t 2048 -R  -D /usr/local/lpcscrypt/scripts/../bin/LPCScrypt_228.bin.hdr
Booted LPCScrypt target (1fc9:000c) with /usr/local/lpcscrypt/scripts/../bin/LPCScrypt_228.bin.hdr
$
```

3. Run `lpcscrypt clockslow`:

```console
$ /usr/local/lpcscrypt/bin/lpcscrypt clockslow
$
```

4. Run `lpcscrypt program +c <path-to-lpc4322_bl_crc.bin> BankA`:

```console
$ /usr/local/lpcscrypt/bin/lpcscrypt program +c ~/hubris/support/lpc4322_bl_crc.bin BankA
..
Programmed 57344 bytes to 0x1a000000 in 0.827s (67.717KB/sec)
$
```

5. Assuming it is successful, remove the DFU jumper and disconnect/reconnect USB

6. There should now be a USB mass storage device named `MAINTENANCE`

7. Copy `lpc4322_lpc55s69xpresso_if_rla_swo_hacks.bin` to the USB drive

```console
$ sudo cp ~/hubris/support/lpc4322_lpc55s69xpresso_if_rla_swo_hacks.bin /mnt
$
```

8. Unmount (or otherwise sync) the USB drive:

```console
# umount /mnt
#
```

9. Unplug and replug the USB cable.

Verify that you are on the new firmware by running `pyocd list`:

```console
$ pyocd list
  #   Probe                        Unique ID

```

Once RickLink is running:

- Terminal 1: `pyocd gdbserver -t lpc55s69` 
- Terminal 2: `telnet localhost 4444` (semihosting output)
- Terminal 3: `cargo xtask gdb lpc55/app.toml openocd.gdb`

### LPC55S28 on Gemini carrier board

Note that the RickLink running on the LPCXpresso55S69 can *also* be used 
as the debugger for the LPC55S28 on the Gemini carrier board.  To do this,
first, follow all of the instructions above to get RickLink onto your
LPCXpresso55S69.  Then:

1. Using a soldering iron, solder a two-pin header on J5. J5 can be
   be found to the left of P1 and below the "Debugger" jumper (J3).

2. Put a jumper on the new header

3. Move the "Debugger" jumper (J3) to "Ext".

4. Use a SWD cable (10-pin 2x5 1.27mm pitch cable) to connect the SWD on the
   LPCXpresso55S69 to the SWD underneath the carrier board on Gemini (J202)

(To allow your RickLink to once again debug its local LPC55S69,
remove the jumper on J5 and move J3 to "Loc".)

### ST Nucleo-H743ZI2 board

- Terminal 1: `cd demo-stm32h7; openocd`
- Terminal 2: `cargo xtask gdb demo-stm32h7/app-h743.toml openocd.gdb`

### ST STM32H7B3I-DK board

- Terminal 1: `cd demo-stm32h7; openocd`
- Terminal 2: `cargo xtask gdb demo-stm32h7/app-h7b3.toml openocd.gdb`

### Multiple boards simultaneously

If multiple probes are attached, tools may struggle to find the right one at
the right time.  In particular, OpenOCD will pick the first one that it finds;
to force OpenOCD to pick a *particular* probe,
you can ascertain the serial number of the probe (e.g., from `humility probe`)
and then specify that serial number in the corresponding `openocd.cfg` by
adding, e.g.:

```
interface hla
hla_serial 271828182845904523536028
```

(Where `271828182845904523536028` is the serial number of the probe.)

## Flash

An image within a Hubris archive can be flashed directly onto a target board
by running `cargo xtask flash` and specifying the appropriate
TOML file.  This will run `cargo xtask dist` and then execute the appropriate
command (either OpenOCD or pyOCD) to flash the image; the exact invocation
depends on the board:

- LPCXpresso55S69: `cargo xtask flash lpc55/app.toml`
- STM32F4 Discovery board: `cargo xtask flash demo/app.toml`
- ST Nucleo-H743ZI2 board: `cargo xtash flash demo-stm32h7/app-h743.toml`
- ST STM32H7B3I-DK board: `cargo xtask flash demo-stm32h7/app-h7b3.toml`
- Gemini bringup board: `cargo xtask flash gemini-bu/app.toml`

## Debug

The Hubris debugger, [Humility](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/humility),
is run _in situ_ by specifying an archive on a directly connected board,
or postmortem by specifying a dump.  As a convenience for development,
Humility can also be run _in situ_ by specifying the appropriate TOML, e.g.
on a machine with an STM32F4 Discovery board directly attached:

```console
$ cargo xtask humility demo/app.toml tasks
    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.17s
     Running `target/debug/xtask humility demo/app.toml tasks`
humility: attached via ST-Link
ID ADDR     TASK               GEN STATE    
 0 20000108 jefe                 0 Healthy(InRecv(None))     
 1 20000178 rcc_driver           0 Healthy(InRecv(None))     
 2 200001e8 usart_driver         0 Healthy(InRecv(None))     
 3 20000258 user_leds            0 Healthy(Runnable)          <-
 4 200002c8 ping                48 Healthy(Runnable)         
 5 20000338 pong                 0 Healthy(InRecv(None))     
 6 200003a8 idle                 0 Healthy(Runnable)         
```

## Testing

The Hubris kernel is tested with a dedicated _test image_ that includes a test
runner, assistant and test suite.  The test image emits its results via ITM.
While these results can be interpreted manually, `humility test` automates
this.  `humility test` itself is most easily run via `cargo xtask test`, which
runs the equivalent of `cargo xtask dist`, `cargo xtask flash`
and `cargo xtask humility test`.  The exact invocation depends on the board:

- LPCXpresso55S69: `cargo xtask test test test/tests-lpc55/app.toml`
- STM32F3 Discovery board: `cargo xtask test test/tests-stm32fx/app-f3.toml`  
  **Note: for this board, SB10 must be soldered closed for ITM to work**
- STM32F4 Discovery board: `cargo xtask test test/tests-stm32fx/app.toml`
- ST Nucleo-H743ZI2 board: `cargo xtask test test/tests-stm32h7/app-h743.toml`
- ST STM32H7B3I-DK board: `cargo xtask test test/tests-stm32h7/app-h7b3.toml`

See the [documentation for `humility
test`](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/humility#humility-test) for details
on test results.

## Debugging tests

Output from tests is captured by `humility test`; `sys_log!()` calls to
tests can be added and then captured in a `humility test` dump.  To capture
a dump from tests that are otherwise passing, use `cargo xtask humility`
directly and pass the `-d` flag, e.g.:

```console
$ cargo xtask humility test/tests-stm32fx/app.toml -- test -d
...
humility: attached via ST-Link
humility: TPIU sync packet found at offset 1
humility: ITM synchronization packet found at offset 12
humility: expecting 22 cases
humility: running test_send ... ok
...
humility: running test_timer_notify ... ok
humility: running test_timer_notify_past ... ok
humility: tests completed: pass
humility: test output dumped to hubris.testout.2
```

if one needs to both run GDB and the test suite, use `cargo xtask gdb`
with the test image's TOML and the appropriate GDB file, and then place
breakpoints at the test of interest.

## Adding a task

To create your own task, the easiest method is:

- Copy `task-template` to a new name.
- Edit its `Cargo.toml` with your name and a new package name.
- Add it to the list of workspace members in the root `Cargo.toml`.

You can now run `cargo xtask build` in the task's directory to run a standalone
build. (See below for details.)

To actually test the task, you need to add it to a system image by editing an
`app.toml` file. A typical entry for a small task that uses no memory-mapped
peripherals would read

```toml
[tasks.name_for_task_in_this_image]
path = "../my-task-directory"
name = "my-task-target-name"
priority = 1
requires = {flash = 1024, ram = 1024}
start = true
```

## Iterating

Because a full image build can take 10 seconds or more, depending on what you've
changed, when you're iterating on a task or kernel you'll probably want to build
it *outside* the context of an image. We have a thing called a "standalone
build" for this.

For instance, to run a standalone build of `task-ping`, run:

```console
$ cd task-ping
$ cargo xtask build
```

This magic happens in three parts:

1. Packages that support standalone build have a `package.metadata.build.target`
   key giving the default target architecture for standalone builds.
2. Our `build.rs` files that receive information from the `dist` xtask will do
   reasonable defaulty things if that information is missing, e.g. in this case.
3. By convention, we set a default feature `"standalone"` for standalone builds,
   and switch it off in the `app.toml` used by the `package` xtask. You can use this
   feature to conditionally compile stuff.

Note: most tasks pick up their `build.rs` behavior implicitly by depending on
`userlib`. You generally do not need a `build.rs` in your task unless you need
to detect compiler/architecture features or depend on board rev.
