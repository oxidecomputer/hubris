# Hubris

[![build](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild)

Hubris is a microcontroller operating environment designed for deeply-embedded
systems with reliability requirements. Its design was initially proposed in
RFD41, but has evolved considerably since then.

# Learning

Developer documentation is in Asciidoc in the `doc/` directory. It gets rendered
via GitHub pages, and is available at https://oxidecomputer.github.io/hubris .

# Navigating

The repo is laid out as follows.

- `app/` is where the top-level binary crates for applications live, e.g.
  `app/gimlet` contains the firmware crate for Gimlet. Generally speaking, if
  you want to build an image for something, look here.

- `build/` contains the build system and supporting crates.

- `chip/` contains peripheral definitions and debugging support files for
  individual microcontrollers.

- `doc/` contains developer documentation.

- `drv/` contains drivers, a mix of simple driver lib crates and fully-fledged
  server bin crates. Current convention is that `drv/SYSTEM-DEVICE` is the
  driver for `DEVICE` on `SYSTEM` (where `SYSTEM` is usually an SoC name),
  whereas `drv/SYSTEM-DEVICE-server` is the server bin crate.

- `idl/` contains interface definitions written in
  [Idol](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/idolatry)

- `lib/` contains assorted utility libraries we've written. If you need to make
  a reusable crate that doesn't fit into one of the other directories, it
  probably belongs here.

- `stage0/` is the bootloader/hypovisor, primarily for LPC55.

- `support/` contains some interface and programming support files, like fake
  certificates and programmer firmware images.

- `sys/` contains the "system" bits of Hubris, namely the kernel (`sys/kern`),
  the shared crate defining the ABI (`sys/abi`), and the user library used by
  tasks (`sys/userlib`).

- `task/` contains reusable tasks that aren't drivers. The distinction between
  things that live in `task` vs in `drv/something-server` is fuzzy. Use your
  judgement.

- `test/` contains the test framework and binary crates for building it for
  various boards.

- `website/` contains the source code for the
  [hubris website](https://hubris.oxide.computer/)

# Developing

We currently support Linux and Windows as first-tier platforms. macOS is also
used on a daily basis by Oxide employees, but is not tested in CI.  The build
probably also works on Illumos; if anyone would like to step up to maintain
support and a continuous build for Illumos or macOS, we'd love the help.

To submit changes for review, push them to a branch in a fork and submit a pull
request to merge that branch into `master`. For details, see
[`CONTRIBUING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Prereqs

You will need:

- A `rustup`-based toolchain install. `rustup` will take care of automatically
  installing our pinned toolchain version, and the cross-compilation targets,
  when you first try to build.

- `openocd` (ideally 0.11) or (if using the LPC55) `pyocd` (0.27 or later).
  Note that the 0.10 release of OpenOCD predates the STLink v3. People are using
  various post-0.10, pre-0.11 builds provided by system package managers, with
  some success, but if your system isn't packaging 0.11 yet, pester them. If
  you're going to use Homebrew on macOS to install OpenOCD, you need to use
  `brew install --head openocd` to build the tip of the main branch rather than
  using the latest binary release. If you need to build from source, you can
  find [OpenOCD v0.11.0 here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openocd/files/openocd/0.11.0/).
  When running `./configure`, make sure that you see that the
  `ST-Link Programmer` is set enabled (which should be the default).

- [libusb](https://libusb.info/), typically found from your system's package
  manager as `libusb-1.0.0` or similar.

- [libfdti1](https://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/), found
  as `libftdi1-dev` or similar.

- If you will be running GDB, you should install `arm-none-eabi-gdb`.  This is
  typically from your system's package manager with a package name like
  `arm-none-eabi-gdb` or `gdb-multiarch`.  macOS users can run
  `brew install --cask gcc-arm-embedded` to install the
  [official ARM binaries](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm).

- The Hubris debugger, [Humility](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/humility).
  Note that `cargo install` interacts strangely with the `rust-toolchain.toml`
  file present in the root of this repository; if you run the following command
  verbatim to install Humility, do so from a different directory:
  - `cargo install --git https://github.com/oxidecomputer/humility.git --locked humility`

### Windows

There are three alternative ways to install OpenOCD:

See [here](https://openocd.org/pages/getting-openocd.html) for getting the source of `openocd`
or get unofficial binaries.

Alternatively, you can install with [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install):

```console
> choco install openocd
```

Lastly, you could install `openocd` with [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```console
> scoop bucket add extras
> scoop install openocd
```
**Note:** `openocd` installed via `scoop` has proven problematic for some
users. If you experience problems, try installing via `choco` or from source
(see above).

To use the ST-Link programmer, you'll probably need to install
[this driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).

It's not necessary to build and run Hubris, but if you want to communicate
over a serial link (and that's not supported by your terminal), you'll want to
use PuTTY; [this guide](https://pbxbook.com/voip/sputty.html)
does a good job of explaining how.

## Build

**We do not use `cargo build` or `cargo run` directly because they are too
inflexible for our purposes.** We have a complex multi-architecture build, which
is a bit beyond them.

Instead, the repo includes a Cargo extension called `xtask` that namespaces our
custom build commands.

`cargo xtask dist TOMLFILE` builds a distribution image for the
application described by the TOML file.

- `cargo xtask dist app/demo-stm32f4-discovery/app.toml` - stm32f4-discovery
- `cargo xtask dist app/demo-stm32f4-discovery/app-f3.toml` - stm32f3-discovery
- `cargo xtask dist app/lpc55xpresso/app.toml` - lpcxpresso55s69
- `cargo xtask dist app/demo-stm32g0-nucleo/app-g031.toml` - stm32g031
- `cargo xtask dist app/demo-stm32g0-nucleo/app-g070.toml` - stm32g070
- `cargo xtask dist app/demo-stm32g0-nucleo/app-g0b1.toml` - stm32g0b1
- `cargo xtask dist app/demo-stm32h7-nucleo/app-h743.toml` - nucleo-ih743zi2
- `cargo xtask dist app/demo-stm32h7-nucleo/app-h753.toml` - nucleo-ih753zi
- `cargo xtask dist app/gemini-bu/app.toml` - Gemini bringup board

## Iterating

Because a full image build can take 10 seconds or more, depending on what you've
changed, when you're iterating on a task or kernel you'll probably want to build
it separately. This is what `cargo xtask build` is for.

For instance, to build `task-ping` as it would be built in one of the images, but
without building the rest of the demo, run:

```console
$ cargo xtask build app/gimletlet/app.toml ping
```

## Running `clippy`
The `cargo xtask clippy` subcommand can be used to run `clippy` against one or
more tasks in the context of a particular image:

```console
$ cargo xtask clippy app/gimletlet/app.toml ping pong
```

## Integrating with `rust-analyzer`
The Hubris build system will not work with `rust-analyzer` out of the box.

However, `cargo xtask lsp` is here to help: it takes as its argument a Rust
file, and returns JSON-encoded configuration for how to set up `rust-analyzer`.

To use this data, some editor configuration is required!

(we haven't made plugins yet, but it would certainly be possible)

Using Neovim and [`rust-tools`](https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim),
here's an example configuration:

```lua
-- monkeypatch rust-tools to correctly detect our custom rust-analyzer
require'rust-tools.utils.utils'.is_ra_server = function (client)
  local name = client.name
  local target = "rust_analyzer"
  return string.sub(client.name, 1, string.len(target)) == target
    or client.name == "rust_analyzer-standalone"
end

-- Configure LSP through rust-tools.nvim plugin, with lots of bonus
-- content for Hubris compatibility
local cache = {}
local clients = {}
require'rust-tools'.setup{
  tools = { -- rust-tools options
    autoSetHints = true,
    inlay_hints = {
      show_parameter_hints = false,
      parameter_hints_prefix = "",
      other_hints_prefix = "",
      -- do other configuration here as desired
    },
  },

  server = {
    on_new_config = function(new_config, new_root_dir)
      local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
      local bufname = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(bufnr)
      local dir = new_config.root_dir()
      if string.find(dir, "hubris") then
        -- Run `xtask lsp` for the target file, which gives us a JSON
        -- dictionary with bonus configuration.
        local prev_cwd = vim.fn.getcwd()
        vim.cmd("cd " .. dir)
        local cmd = dir .. "/target/debug/xtask lsp "
        -- Notify `xtask lsp` of existing clients in the CLI invocation,
        -- so it can check against them first (which would mean a faster
        -- attach)
        for _,v in pairs(clients) do
          local c = vim.fn.escape(vim.json.encode(v), '"')
          cmd = cmd .. '-c"' .. c .. '" '
        end
        local handle = io.popen(cmd .. bufname)
        handle:flush()
        local result = handle:read("*a")
        handle:close()
        vim.cmd("cd " .. prev_cwd)

        -- If `xtask` doesn't know about `lsp`, then it will print an error to
        -- stderr and return nothing on stdout.
        if result == "" then
          vim.notify("recompile `xtask` for `lsp` support", vim.log.levels.WARN)
        end

        -- If the given file should be handled with special care, then
        -- we give the rust-analyzer client a custom name (to prevent
        -- multiple buffers from attaching to it), then cache the JSON in
        -- a local variable for use in `on_attach`
        local json = vim.json.decode(result)
        if json["Ok"] ~= nil then
          new_config.name = "rust_analyzer_" .. json.Ok.hash
          cache[bufnr] = json
          table.insert(clients, {toml = json.Ok.app, task = json.Ok.task})
        else
          -- TODO:
          -- vim.notify(vim.inspect(json.Err), vim.log.levels.ERROR)
        end
      end
    end,

    on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
      local json = cache[bufnr]
      if json ~= nil then
        local config = vim.deepcopy(client.config)
        local ra = config.settings["rust-analyzer"]
        -- Do rust-analyzer builds in a separate folder to avoid blocking
        -- the main build with a file lock.
        table.insert(json.Ok.buildOverrideCommand, "--target-dir")
        table.insert(json.Ok.buildOverrideCommand, "target/rust-analyzer")
        ra.cargo = {
          extraEnv = json.Ok.extraEnv,
          features = json.Ok.features,
          noDefaultFeatures = true,
          target = json.Ok.target,
          buildScripts = {
            overrideCommand = json.Ok.buildOverrideCommand,
          },
        }
        ra.check = {
          overrideCommand = json.Ok.buildOverrideCommand,
        }
        config.lspinfo = function()
          return { "Hubris app:      " .. json.Ok.app,
                   "Hubris task:     " .. json.Ok.task }
        end
        client.config = config
      end
    end,

    settings = {
      ["rust-analyzer"] = {
        -- enable clippy on save
        checkOnSave = {
          command = "clippy",
          extraArgs = { '--target-dir', 'target/rust-analyzer' },
        },
        diagnostics = {
          disabled = {"inactive-code"},
        },
      }
    }
  },
}
end
```

### What's going on here?
When a new LSP configuration is created (`on_new_config`), we run `cargo
xtask lsp` on the target file.  The JSON configuration includes a hash of
the configuration; we use that hash to modify the name of the client from
`rust_analyzer` to `rust_analyzer_$HASH`.  This prevents Neovim from
attempting to reuse an existing client, which are normally deduplicated by
client name and workspace root directory; in Hubris, we want multiple clients
coexisting with same workspace root, so they need different names.  Then, we
stash the rest of the configuration in a local variable (`cache`), and record
the existence of this client in `clients`.

When attaching to the LSP, we try to pull the configuration out of `cache`.  If
one exists, then we know we're dealing with a Hubris buffer; copy over relevant
portions of the configuration.

Note that this does not compile `xtask` for you; it assumes it already exists
in `target/debug/xtask`.  This should be true if you're using Hubris regularly,
and saves significant amounts of time when opening a new file.

## Adding a task

To create your own task, the easiest method is:

- Copy `task/template` to a new name.
- Edit its `Cargo.toml` with your name and a new package name.
- Add it to the list of workspace members in the root `Cargo.toml`.
- Add it to a system image by editing an `app.toml` file.
- Run `cargo xtask build` to compile it.

A typical `app.toml` entry for a small task that uses no memory-mapped
peripherals would read

```toml
[tasks.name_for_task_in_this_image]
name = "my-task-target-name"
priority = 1
requires = {flash = 1024, ram = 1024}
start = true
```

## Graphing task relationships and priorities

A graph can be generated that show the relationships of the various tasks
and their priorities. The resulting file is in [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)'s
`dot` format. `Dot` source [can be included](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/) in [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org) source
or rendered to a variety of formats.

To create and view an SVG graph for `gimletlet` on Ubuntu, ensure that the `graphviz` package is installed. Then generate the graph:

```console
$ cargo xtask graph -o gimletlet.dot app/gimletlet/app.toml
$ dot -Tsvg gimletlet.dot > gimletlet.svg
$ xdg-open gimletlet.svg
```

### Generating all graphs under Linux

Bash commands to generate all graphs:

```console
  APPS=( $(find app -name '*.toml' ! -name Cargo.toml) )
  for app in "${APPS[@]}"
  do
    out=$(basename ${app//\//_} .toml).dot
    svg=$(basename $out .dot).svg
    cargo xtask graph -o $out $app
    dot -Tsvg $out > $svg
  done
  first="${APPS[0]}"
  out="$(basename ${first//\//_} .toml).dot"
  svg="$(basename $out .dot).svg"
  xdg-open "${svg}"
```

If `eog` is the default viewer, opening the first SVG in a directory will
allow cycling through all of the available graphs using the same window.

# Using Hubris
Hubris is tightly coupled to its debugger,
[Humility](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/humility),
which is used for the commands below either implicitly
(in `cargo xtask flash`) or explicitly (in `cargo xtask humility`).

If the `humility` binary is not available on your `$PATH`, the `HUBRIS_HUMILITY_PATH`
environment variable may be used to provide the path to the binary.

## Flash

An image within a Hubris archive can be flashed directly onto a target board
by running `cargo xtask flash` and specifying the appropriate
TOML file.  This will run `cargo xtask dist` and then pass the resulting
build archive to `humility flash`. `humility` will invoke either OpenOCD or
pyOCD to flash the image; the exact invocation depends on the board
and is encoded in the build archive.

- LPCXpresso55S69: `cargo xtask flash app/lpc55xpresso/app.toml`
- STM32F4 Discovery board: `cargo xtask flash app/demo-stm32f4-discovery/app.toml`
- ST Nucleo-H743ZI2 board: `cargo xtask flash app/demo-stm32h7-nucleo/app-h743.toml`
- ST Nucleo-H753ZI board: `cargo xtask flash app/demo-stm32h7-nucleo/app-h753.toml`
- Gemini bringup board: `cargo xtask flash app/gemini-bu/app.toml`

## Running Humility

Humility is run _in situ_ by specifying an archive on a directly connected
board, or postmortem by specifying a dump.  As a convenience for development,
Humility can also be run _in situ_ by specifying the appropriate TOML, e.g.
on a machine with an STM32F4 Discovery board directly attached:

```console
$ cargo xtask humility app/demo-stm32f4-discovery/app.toml -- tasks
    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.17s
     Running `target/debug/xtask humility demo/app.toml -- tasks`
humility: attached via ST-Link
ID ADDR     TASK               GEN STATE    
 0 20000108 jefe                 0 Healthy(InRecv(None))     
 1 20000178 rcc_driver           0 Healthy(InRecv(None))     
 2 200001e8 usart_driver         0 Healthy(InRecv(None))     
 3 20000258 user_leds            0 Healthy(Runnable)          <-
 4 200002c8 ping                48 Healthy(Runnable)         
 5 20000338 pong                 0 Healthy(InRecv(None))     
 6 200003a8 idle                 0 Healthy(Runnable)         
```

### Debugging with GDB
`humility` includes a `gdb` subcommand which attaches to a running system
using `arm-none-eabi-gdb`, optionally running its own `openocd` instance based
on configuration data in the build archive.

For convenience, there's also a `cargo xtask gdb` façade which calls `humility`
with the appropriate build archive:

```console
$ cargo xtask gdb app/demo-stm32f4-discovery/app.toml -- --run-openocd
# ... lots of output elided ...
task_idle::main () at task/idle/src/main.rs:14
14          loop {
Breakpoint 1 at 0x800434c: file /crates.io/cortex-m-rt-0.6.15/src/lib.rs, line 560.
Note: automatically using hardware breakpoints for read-only addresses.
semihosting is enabled

semihosting is enabled

(gdb)
```

Note that `cargo xtask gdb` will (by default) also run `dist` and `flash`, to
ensure that the image on the chip is up to date.  The `-n`/`--noflash` option
skips these steps.

# Testing Hubris

The Hubris kernel is tested with a dedicated _test image_ that includes a test
runner, assistant and test suite.  The test image emits its results via ITM.
While these results can be interpreted manually, `humility test` automates
this.  `humility test` itself is most easily run via `cargo xtask test`, which
runs the equivalent of `cargo xtask dist`, `cargo xtask flash`
and `cargo xtask humility test`.  The exact invocation depends on the board:

- LPCXpresso55S69: `cargo xtask test test/tests-lpc55xpresso/app.toml`
- STM32F3 Discovery board: `cargo xtask test test/tests-stm32fx/app-f3.toml`  
  **Note: for this board, SB10 must be soldered closed for ITM to work**
- STM32F4 Discovery board: `cargo xtask test test/tests-stm32fx/app.toml`
- ST Nucleo-H743ZI2 board: `cargo xtask test test/tests-stm32h7/app-h743.toml`
- ST Nucleo-H753ZI board: `cargo xtask test test/tests-stm32h7/app-h753.toml`

Note: `cargo xtask humility test` runs OpenOCD to connect to the device.
You must exit any other instances of OpenOCD that you have connected to the device
before running tests.

See the [documentation for `humility
test`](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/humility#humility-test) for details
on test results.

## Debugging tests

Output from tests is captured by `humility test`; `sys_log!()` calls to
tests can be added and then captured in a `humility test` dump.  To capture
a dump from tests that are otherwise passing, use `cargo xtask humility`
directly and pass the `-d` flag, e.g.:

```console
$ cargo xtask humility test/tests-stm32fx/app.toml -- test -d
...
humility: attached via ST-Link
humility: TPIU sync packet found at offset 1
humility: ITM synchronization packet found at offset 12
humility: expecting 22 cases
humility: running test_send ... ok
...
humility: running test_timer_notify ... ok
humility: running test_timer_notify_past ... ok
humility: tests completed: pass
humility: test output dumped to hubris.testout.2
```

if one needs to both run GDB and the test suite, use `cargo xtask gdb`
with the test image's TOML and the appropriate GDB file, and then place
breakpoints at the test of interest.

# Special cases
## Gemini bringup board

See the Gemini Bringup
[Getting Started](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/gemini-bringup/tree/master/gemini-bringup)
docs (internal Oxide repo)

## STM32F3 Discovery boards
**For the STM32F3 Discovery board, SB10 must be soldered closed for ITM
to work!** This solder bridge defaults to being open, which leaves SWO
disconnected.  See the STM32F3 Discovery User Manual (UM1570) for schematic
and details.

## LPCXpresso55S69 board

To use the LPCXpresso55S69, you will need [pyOCD](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD), version 0.27.0 or later.

The LPCXpresso55S69 is somewhat of a mess because the built-on on-chip
debugger, LPC-Link2, [does not correctly support SWO/SWV](https://community.nxp.com/t5/LPC-Microcontrollers/SWO-SWV-on-LPC-Link2-with-CMSIS-DAP/m-p/1079442)

If you have the stock LPC-Link2, it will report itself this way via `pyocd list`:


```console
$ pyocd list
  #   Probe                                           Unique ID
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  0   NXP Semiconductors LPC-LINK2 CMSIS-DAP V5.361   JSAQCQIQ
```

It's also possible that you have the Segger J-Link firmware -- firmware
that will make its odious presence known by prompting for you to accept license
terms whenever running `pyocd list`!

```console
$ pyocd list
  #   Probe                                                       Unique ID
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0   Segger J-Link LPCXpresso V2 compiled Apr  4 2019 16:54:03   726424936
```

In either of these cases you must -- as a one-time step -- install new
firmware on the LPC-Link2.  The new firmware is a build of the (open source) 
[DAPLink](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/DAPLink), which
we affectionally call **RickLink** after
the engineer who managed to get it all built -- no small feat!

There are two files that you will need, both contained in the Hubris repository:

- [lpc4322_bl_crc.bin](./support/lpc4322_bl_crc.bin)
- [lpc4322_lpc55s69xpresso_if_rla_swo_hacks.bin](./support/lpc4322_lpc55s69xpresso_if_rla_swo_hacks.bin)

You will additionally need the [LPCScrypt program](https://www.nxp.com/design/microcontrollers-developer-resources/lpc-microcontroller-utilities/lpcscrypt-v2-1-1:LPCSCRYPT)
from NXP.

Here are the steps to install RickLink:

1. Install the DFU jumper. This can be found next to the SWD header on the
left side of the board; it is labelled "DFU".

2. Run `scripts/boot_lpcscrypt` from the installed LPCScrypt software:

```console
$ /usr/local/lpcscrypt/scripts/boot_lpcscrypt 
Looking for DFU devices with VID 1fc9 PID 000c ...
dfu-util -d 1fc9:000c -c 1 -i 0 -t 2048 -R  -D /usr/local/lpcscrypt/scripts/../bin/LPCScrypt_228.bin.hdr
Booted LPCScrypt target (1fc9:000c) with /usr/local/lpcscrypt/scripts/../bin/LPCScrypt_228.bin.hdr
$
```

3. Run `lpcscrypt clockslow`:

```console
$ /usr/local/lpcscrypt/bin/lpcscrypt clockslow
$
```

4. Run `lpcscrypt program +w1 0x0 BankA` to overwrite existing firmware

```console
$ /usr/local/lpcscrypt/bin/lpcscrypt program +w1 0x0 BankA

Programmed 524288 bytes to 0x1a000000 in 2.610s (196.165KB/sec)
$
```

5. Run `lpcscrypt program +c <path-to-lpc4322_bl_crc.bin> BankA`:

```console
$ /usr/local/lpcscrypt/bin/lpcscrypt program +c ~/hubris/support/lpc4322_bl_crc.bin BankA
..
Programmed 57344 bytes to 0x1a000000 in 0.827s (67.717KB/sec)
$
```

6. Assuming it is successful, remove the DFU jumper and disconnect/reconnect USB

7. There should now be a USB mass storage device named `MAINTENANCE`

8. Copy `lpc4322_lpc55s69xpresso_if_rla_swo_hacks.bin` to the USB drive

```console
$ sudo cp ~/hubris/support/lpc4322_lpc55s69xpresso_if_rla_swo_hacks.bin /mnt
$
```

9. Unmount (or otherwise sync) the USB drive:

```console
# umount /mnt
#
```

10. Unplug and replug the USB cable.

Verify that you are on the new firmware by running `pyocd list`:

```console
$ pyocd list
  #   Probe                        Unique ID

## LPC55S28 on Gemini carrier board

Note that the RickLink running on the LPCXpresso55S69 can *also* be used 
as the debugger for the LPC55S28 on the Gemini carrier board.  To do this,
first, follow all of the instructions above to get RickLink onto your
LPCXpresso55S69.  Then:

1. Using a soldering iron, solder a two-pin header on J5. J5 can be
   be found to the left of P1 and below the "Debugger" jumper (J3).

2. Put a jumper on the new header

3. Move the "Debugger" jumper (J3) to "Ext".

4. Use a SWD cable (10-pin 2x5 1.27mm pitch cable) to connect the SWD on the
   LPCXpresso55S69 to the SWD underneath the carrier board on Gemini (J202)

(To allow your RickLink to once again debug its local LPC55S69,
remove the jumper on J5 and move J3 to "Loc".)

## Multiple boards simultaneously

If multiple probes are attached, tools may struggle to find the right one at
the right time.  In particular, OpenOCD will pick the first one that it finds;
to force OpenOCD to pick a *particular* probe,
you can ascertain the serial number of the probe (e.g., from `humility probe`)
and then specify that serial number in the corresponding `openocd.cfg` by
adding, e.g.:

```
interface hla
hla_serial 271828182845904523536028
```

(Where `271828182845904523536028` is the serial number of the probe.)

## Updating ST-Link Firmware if necessary

It is common that debugging dongles, and development boards with embedded
debug hardware like the Nucleo series, are delivered with older firmware.

You will not be able to use Humilty with outdated ST-Link firmware. Humility
will tell you this is the case, for example when attempting to use `humility test`:

```
...
Warn : Adding extra erase range, 0x08020060 .. 0x0803ffff
** Programming Finished **
** Verify Started **
** Verified OK **
** Resetting Target **
humility: test failed: The firmware on the probe is outdated
Error: test failed
```

software and instructions necessary to install current firmware.
