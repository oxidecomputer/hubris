# Board definitions

This directory contains a file specifying each supported board (for the `board`
key in the `app.toml` and the `target_board` `cfg` in Rust).

Currently the contents of the files are ... minimal. The mere existence of a
file creates a board with the corresponding name, as far as the build system is
concerned.
