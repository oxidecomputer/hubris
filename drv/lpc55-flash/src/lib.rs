/// # Procedure for writing to flash
///
/// 1. Use `start_erase_region` to begin an erase of your desired region. Use
///    `poll_erase_or_program_result` to discover when it's done. (Note: you can
///    use `start_blank_check` to skip this step if there's a chance the flash
///    is already erased.)
/// 2. Call `start_write_row` with each 16 byte chunk of the first page you're
///    writing, 32 times, for rows 0-31. Each time, use `poll_write_result` to
///    check that it's done.
/// 3. Call `start_program` with the index of any word in the target flash page
///    to begin the programming process. (See the next section on word numbers
///    for explanation.) Use `poll_erase_or_program_result` to learn when it's
///    done.
/// 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each page in the region you want to write.
///
/// # Flash addressing and word numbers
///
/// While the flash is directly addressable by the processor at byte
/// granularity, most of the flash controller operations work in terms of a
/// _word number._ Internal flash words are 16 bytes (128 bits) in length; the
/// word number is the index of a word within the flash, starting at 0.
///
/// The flash controller thinks entirely in word numbers, _including on
/// operations that deal in pages._ For example, to erase a range of pages, you
/// give the hardware a range of word numbers, _not_ page numbers, and it erases
/// the sequence of contiguous pages that contain the start and end word
/// numbers. In the interest of not introducing additional, confusable, types of
/// addresses, this API preserves this and deals only in word numbers.
///
/// Should you need to convert a direct-addressed flash location (byte address)
/// to a word number, the procedure is:
///
/// - Divide by 16 (or right-shift by 4).
/// - Mask all but the bottom 18 bits.
///
/// Note: The `start_write_row` operation does not use _absolute_ flash word
/// numbers, but uses equivalent indices within a 512-byte internal page
/// register.
