        // The MAX7358 has a really, really regrettable idea:  it has a
        // "special" (their words) sequence sent to expose enhanced
        // functionality.  The sequence consists of I2C operations that one
        // would never see from a functional initiator:  a zero-byte write
        // followed by a zero-byte read, followed by a zero-byte write,
        // followed by a zero-byte read.  (Because this evokes storied cheat
        // sequences in video games, we choose to call this a "Konami Code.")
        // This is bad enough, but it actually gets worse: this doesn't seem
        // to always work correctly.  In particular, there seem to be modes in
        // which the device confuses the zero-byte read that is the second
        // operation for an *actual* read -- and tries to return the contents
        // of register 0 (which is its defined behavior on a read).  This is
        // not (at all) what the initiator-side is expecting, and, because
        // register 0 is the SwitchControl register which is itself zeroed on
        // reset, this condition results in SDA appearing to be being held low
        // -- and the controller (rightfully) indicates that arbitration is
        // lost.  When this condition has been seen (namely, on hard power
        // on), it is resolved as soon as the initiator emits enough SCL
        // iterations (i.e., controller restarts) for SDA to be let go: a
        // subsequent issuing of the sequence is handled properly in the cases
        // that we've seen.  However, we have also found that issuing a
        // (proper) read ahead of issuing the Konami Code appears to put the
        // part in a better frame of mind -- so we choose to do this, with the
        // hope that it will prevent the caller from needing to reset the
        // controller entirely several times over.
