//! Driver for the DS18B20 Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer
//!
//! This is a basic driver for converting and reading the temperature on
//! a DS18B20.  This driver is naive in several regards:
//!
//! - It assumes that the bus is shared with other devices.  If the bus
//!   were to only consist of a single device, `SkipROM` could be used
//!   in lieu of `MatchROM`
//!
//! - It can only have one device perform a conversion (via `MatchROM`)
//!   rather than having all devices begin a concurrent conversion
//!   (via `SkipROM`)
//!
//! - It makes no use of the alarm functionality
//!
//! - It doesn't allow the resolution to be altered (default is 12-bit)
//!
//! - It makes no attempt to assure that a read following a temperature
//!   conversion has waited sufficiently for the conversion to latch.
//!   It is up to the caller to assure this has waited sufficiently, or
//!   to otherwise understand that the read may result in stale data.
//!   Maximun conversion times for this part, per the datasheet:
//!
//!   - 9-bit resolution: 93.75 ms
//!   - 10-bit resolution: 187.5 ms
//!   - 11-bit resolution: 375 ms
//!   - 12-bit resolution: 750 ms
//!
//!   (In practice, ~650 ms conversion times for 12-bit resolution have
//!   been seen.)
