//!
//! # General notes on PSC power supply sequencing
//!
//! There are rules to follow here to avoid glitching the power supplies,
//! because glitching the power supplies here will glitch the entire rack,
//! making you very unpopular very quickly.
//!
//! **`ON_L` signals to the PSUs:** we normally leave our pins high-impedance on
//! these nets, allowing external resistors to pull them low. We only drive them
//! to _disable_ the PSU by driving it high. To achieve this, we leave the pin
//! configured as an input, pre-load the output value as "high," and toggle its
//! mode register between input and output.
//!
//! **`PRESENT_L` signals from the PSUs:** pulled inactive-high by resistors on
//! the board and power shelf. When these go low, assume they will bounce,
//! because they're brought low by a physical connection between pins on our
//! connector.
//!
//! **`OK` signals from the PSUs:** pulled ACTIVE-high by resistors on the
//! board, in all caps because resistors pulling something active is somewhat
//! unusual. The PSU drives this open drain, so it will only go low if the PSU
//! pulls it low to indicate a problem. This implies that, if the PSU is not
//! detected as present, you cannot trust the `OK` signal.
//!
//!
//! # Intended behavior
//!
//! Let's ignore task restarts / crashes for the moment.
//!
//! The PSC is intended to be hot swappable. If the PSC gets plugged in, this
//! task will start anew (along with the rest of the firmware), with RAM cleared
//! and peripherals in reset state. This will also happen if the PSC is plugged
//! into a rack that is then plugged into power -- we can't usefully distinguish
//! these cases, nor do we need to.
//!
//! When the PSC is *removed* from the system, the pull resistors on the power
//! supply ON signals cause the power supplies to turn on. It's important that
//! we don't override this when the PSU is reinserted. So, at startup, the PSC
//! must leave the ON lines undriven, allowing them to float low.
//!
//! Because the PSC's connector is not designed for hot swap, we can't
//! necessarily trust our inputs at power-on. Without a firm "all connections
//! made" indication from the connector, the best we can do is assume that the
//! connector insertion cycle will finish within some time interval. We delay
//! for this time interval before looking at any inputs. During this time, the
//! power supplies will be on.
//!
//! At that point, we can start our main management loop, which continuously
//! does the following for each power supply separately:
//!
//! - Watch for the presence line to be high (PSU removed).
//! - Record that the PSU is missing.
//! - Start driving its ON signal high.
//! - Wait for the presence line to be low (PSU reinserted).
//! - Release its ON signal so it may turn on normally.
//!
//! Simultaneously, while the PSU is not removed, we monitor the OK signal for
//! indication of internal faults, and periodically poll PMBus status registers
//! for faults that may not be indicated through the OK signal. (The behavior of
//! the OK signal is not super clear from Murata's documentation.) If we find a
//! fault, we...
//!
//! - Record as much information as we can reasonably gather.
//! - Start driving the ON signal high to force the PSU off.
//! - Wait some time to allow things to discharge.
//! - Turn the PSU back on.
//! - Wait some time for it to wake.
//! - Start watching the fault signal again.
//!
//! Removing and reinserting a PSU in general clears the fault state _and_
//! resets the retry counter.
//!
//!
//! # Generalizing to task restarts
//!
//! This task is not intended to restart under normal operation, but bugs
//! happen. We can attempt to maintain glitch-free (or at least low-glitch)
//! operation in the face of this task crashing by doing the following:
//!
//! At task startup, read the status of the ON output pins. If we find that one
//! of the PSUs is off, assume that we turned it off in a previous incarnation
//! before losing state. Begin a fault recovery sequence (above) on that PSU as
//! if we had newly detected a fault.
//!
//! Task crashes will reset the fault counter and timeout. This is unavoidable
//! without keeping state across incarnations, which we're trying to avoid to
//! reduce the likelihood of crashloops.
//!
//! Task crashes may also reactivate a PSU that the control plane had commanded
//! off. Currently this is unavoidable; we might want to record such overrides
//! in the FRAM to be safe.
