//! Code for programming an iCE40 FPGA using separate GPIO and SPI servers.
//!
//! **Note:** this code makes an environmental assumption that you are not using
//! the task timer for anything else, because it uses it to implement delays. If
//! your task only uses `hl::sleep` and friends, you're safe.
//!
//! This module provides reset and bitstream load support for iCE40 FPGAs
//! connected over SPI. To use this module,
//!
//! 1. Create a `Config` struct filled out with your wiring details.
//! 2. Call `configure_pins`, or arrange to configure the CRESET/CDONE pins
//!    yourself.
//! 3. Call `begin_bitstream_load` once.
//! 4. Call `continue_bitstream_load` as many times as you need to, passing
//!    chunks of data each time.
//! 5. Call `finish_bitstream_load` once to complete the process and check the
//!    result.
//!
//! If any of the operations fail, the intention is that you restart the process
//! from `begin_bitstream_load` -- it should handle the reset and clean up from
//! the earlier failure. However, this is only _somewhat_ tested.
