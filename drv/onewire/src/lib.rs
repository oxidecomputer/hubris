/// Search a 1-wire bus for the next device.
///
/// Each 1-wire device has its own (unique) 64-bit identifier, and the way
/// these values are discovered with just a single wire is actually pretty
/// nifty:  first, the bus is reset and a command is sent indicating that a
/// new search is to begin (this is done via the `reset_search` closure).
/// Then, for a given bit position, every device on the bus sends their bit at
/// that position, followed by its inverse.  If every device agrees (that is,
/// if everyone has the same value at a given bit position), the initiator
/// will see the value followed by its inverse.  If, however, there is
/// disagreement, the initiator will see the same value twice (some devices
/// will pull the bus low for the bit, some will pull it low for its inverse).
/// At that point -- a branch point -- the initiator will send either a 0 or 1
/// to indicate which path it wants to take.  Devices on the bus will look
/// for this bit indicating desired path; those whose bit in the current
/// position does not match the bit sent will fall out, remaining
/// silent for the reset of the search.
///
/// The routine that sends communication to the 1-wire bus is the closure
/// `triplet`: it takes a boolean, which tells the initiator what its
/// disposition should be in the event of a branch at this bit position (that
/// is, if it should choose a 1 vs. a 0).  This closure returns a tuple,
/// indicating the direction taken -- and if that direction constitutes a
/// branch (that is, if some devices have a 0 and others a 1 at this bit
/// position).  This routine will be called 64 times (once for each bit
/// position), with the return value being a tuple consisting of the resulting
/// identifier (itself representing the path taken through the tree of device
/// IDs) along with the branch state 2-tuple.
///
/// On subsequent calls to search for additional devices, the returned branch
/// state 2-tuple should be passed back in `branches`; this will assure that
/// the subsequent search function makes a different decision at its deepest
/// branch.  Once both branches have been taken for a given branching point in
/// the tree, that subtree is pruned.
///
/// This algorithm is neat, but it's not quick -- and if the 1-wire device is
/// sitting on the other side of an I2C bridge, it's even slower.
