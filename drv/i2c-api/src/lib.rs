//! This API allows for access to I2C devices.  The actual I2C bus

//! marshalling (and unmarshalling) of messages to (and replies from) this
//! task to perform I2C operations.
//!
//! # I2C devices
//!
//! An I2C device is uniquely identified by a 5-tuple:
//!
//! - The I2C controller in the MCU
//! - The port for that controller, identifying a bus
//! - The multiplexer on the specified I2C bus, if any
//! - The segment on the multiplexer, if a multiplexer is specified
//! - The address of the device itself
