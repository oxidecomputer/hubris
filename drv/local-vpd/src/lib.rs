//! Driver to read vital product data (VPD) from the local FRU ID EEPROM.
//!
//! `read_config` reads from the *local* EEPROM; i.e. is the one soldered to the
//! PCB itself.  The app TOML file must have one AT24xx named `local_vpd`; we
//! use that name to pick which EEPROM to read in `read_config`.
