= Tasks

Other than the kernel, all the code in a Hubris application lives in one or more
_tasks._ Tasks are programs that run in the processor's _unprivileged mode,_
subject to memory isolation. This means that tasks cannot directly stomp on
memory owned by the kernel, or each other.

== Separate compilation

Tasks are _separately compiled_ and do not share code. This is both good and
bad. Some advantages:

- Libraries that, for whatever reason, use static global data can't accidentally
  propagate failures from one task to another.
- Each task can customize the libraries it uses with different feature flags,
  without unexpected effects on other tasks.
- Tasks can use totally different compiler optimization levels.
- Tasks can, in theory, be written in entirely different programming languages,
  from assembler to C to Rust.

The main disadvantage is that it makes the application _bigger._ If three tasks
all use the `useful_code` library, the application will contain three copies of
that library's code in Flash.

NOTE: We could improve this situation by introducing an equivalent to shared
libraries -- something similar to another physically addressed system, such as
Microware OS9. This would be a significant amount of work because all the off
the shelf tooling we have access to assumes that shared libraries go hand in
hand with virtual addressing. So, we have punted for now.

== Tasks can't be created or destroyed

An application declares all of its tasks in its `app.toml` config file, which
the build system processes to make an application image. The set of tasks
declared in that file is the set of tasks the application has, period. Unlike
most operating systems, Hubris does not support creating new tasks at runtime or
destroying existing tasks. This is on purpose. Task creation is a common source
of hard-to-account-for dynamic resource usage, which can allow denial of service
attacks.

Put another way, you can't write a fork-bomb without fork.

This has a bunch of advantages, including:

- It simplifies very important kernel code and data structures used to keep
  track of tasks.
- It means we can check the peak memory consumption of the system under load _at
  compile time,_ since there's no way to create tasks in response to load.
- It makes the addresses of tasks in physical memory predictable, simplifying
  the debugger.

It _does_ put some requirements on your design of applications, however, if
you're accustomed to being able to clone tasks in response to load. Hubris
applications tend to be somewhat economical with tasks, such as by having a
single task process multiple streams of data, so that the task's resources can
be bounded no matter how many streams arrive.

NOTE: While tasks can't be destroyed, they _can_ be halted due to faults or
other events. More on that below.

== Failure and supervision

Hubris is built on the assumption that individual tasks may _fail._ A task fails
by causing a _fault_ -- or, more precisely, by taking an action that causes the
kernel to assign a fault to it. There are a wide variety of faults in Hubris,
and they fall into three main categories:

1. **Hardware faults.** Hardware faults are delivered by the CPU in response to
program actions. Examples include dereferencing a null pointer, trying to access
another task's memory, jumping into non-executable RAM, and executing
instructions that are illegal in unprivileged mode.

2. **Syscall faults.** Syscall faults occur when the task makes a syscall into
the kernel, and _does it wrong._ Programmer errors that are indicated with error
return codes in other operating systems are syscall faults in Hubris -- under
the theory that misuse of a syscall indicates a failed, malfunctioning program. 

3. **Explicit panics.** Tasks may volunteer that they have failed by using a
syscall to panic. In Rust, this maps to the `panic!` macro.

Regardless of the source, when a task faults, it

- Immediately loses the CPU,
- Has its state preserved to the extent possible, and
- Has its fault recorded by the kernel.

Hubris itself does not restart faulted tasks. Instead, a designated task called
the _supervisor_ can be notified when a task faults and take action. Normally,
the supervisor's response will be to read information about the fault from the
kernel, log that somewhere, and ask the kernel to _reinitialize_ the failed
task, as described in the next section.

== Initialization and re-initialization

At boot, the Hubris kernel sets some number of tasks to run. (The application
can designate which tasks to start at boot in its `app.toml`.) Later, the kernel
may need to restart failed tasks, on request from the supervisor. Hubris
deliberately uses the same code path for both of these operations.

The steps taken when (re)initializing a task are:

1. Increment the task's _generation number._ This is a small counter kept on
each task that tracks restarts.

2. Identify any _other_ tasks that were blocked interacting with this task's
previous generation. Unblock them, delivering a _dead code_ to tell them what
happened. (This is explained in more detail in the chapter on IPC.)

3. Reset the task's registers to their initial values, which were chosen at
compile time based on information in the `app.toml`.

4. "Scribble" the task's stack memory with a recognizable pattern. This helps
catch accesses to uninitialized stack memory (in languages other than Rust) and
can be used by the debugger to determine each task's actual peak stack usage, by
looking for how much of it has been overwritten.

5. Mark the task as runnable.

When the task first runs, it will generally initialize its `data` section and
zero its `bss` section. The Hubris kernel doesn't do this _for_ the task because
we don't want to make too many assumptions about task internal memory layouts.
For tasks written in Rust, this is handled by the `_start` routine provided by
the `userlib` crate, and should "just work" -- by the time execution reaches
`main`, memory is set up.

It's worth noting a few things that the kernel does _not_ do during reinit:

- It doesn't reset the task's memory protection configuration, since it's
  constant and can't be changed.
- It doesn't initialize the task's `data` or zero its `bss`. We leave this to
  the task itself, so that we don't make too many assumptions about task
  internal memory layout. (For programs written in Rust, this is handled by the
  `_start` routine in `userlib` before execution reaches `main`.)
- It doesn't do anything to the task's executable code, which is assumed to be
  in execute-in-place Flash and immutable. (Hubris has no equivalent to a
  "loader.")
