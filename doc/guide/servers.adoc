= Servers

A **server** in Hubris is any task that receives messages to implement some API.
This section looks at how servers work, how to implement one using low and high
level APIs, and provides some tips.

== The role of a server

Servers normally spend most of their time hanging out in RECV. This ensures that
they're ready to handle incoming messages.

In the simplest case, after doing any initialization required on startup, a
server will:

- RECV to collect a request.
- Inspect the request and figure out what needs done.
- Do it.
- Reply.
- Repeat.

This simple version covers _most_ servers on Hubris, believe it or not. All the
complexity, and application-specific logic, is hidden in the "do it" step.

[#uphill-send]
== Servers are clients too

The vast majority of servers need to send messages to other servers to do their
jobs. Most servers will turn a single incoming client message into a sequence of
messages to other servers to perform useful work.

When designing a collection of servers in an application, remember that it's
only safe to send messages to _higher priority_ servers (called the "uphill send
rule"). Sending messages to lower priority servers can cause starvation and
deadlock.

NOTE: The kernel will enforce this, eventually.

== When _not_ to use a server

Servers are tasks. Tasks are relatively expensive -- they require separate code
and data storage and stack space. When designing an API consider whether it
should be a server task -- or just a crate.

You may want a server if any of these are true:

- There will be several client tasks, particularly if it's important for only
  one of them to be performing an operation at a time (mutual exclusion).
- The implementation needs to do something clever or `unsafe`, such that you
  want it isolated in memory away from other tasks.
- You need the code to be able to crash and restart separately from other code.
- You need to have multiple concurrent state machines responding to messages and
  notifications. (This is hard to do inside another task.)

Signs that you may just want a crate:

- This task and another task (or a whole group of tasks!) will _never_ be
  runnable at the same time. For instance, only one device driver on an I2C bus
  can be using the bus at any given time. (See the section on drivers, below.)
- There will be a single client, _or_ there will be multiple clients but the
  code is fairly small and no mutual-exclusion is required.
- You don't expect crashes and can return `Err` for failures.
- You're not being weird with `unsafe`.

== Low-level (syscall) implementation

Here is a full implementation of a server for a very simple IPC protocol: it
maintains a 32-bit integer, and can add or subtract values and return the
result.

This implementation uses syscalls directly and no abstractions, to show you
exactly what's happening under the hood. In practice, we rarely write servers
this way -- the next section shows a higher-level equivalent.

This server supports two messages, `add` (0) and `sub` (1). Both messages expect
a four-byte payload, which is a `u32` in little-endian byte order. On success,
the messages update the server state `the_integer` and return the new value, as
another four-byte little-endian integer.

<1> This is the server's local state. It's common for servers to keep their
state on the stack, but larger state might be better placed in a `static`.
<2> The server maintains a 4-byte buffer for incoming messages. This means that
any longer message will be truncated.
<3> The server uses `sys_recv_open` to accept messages from any caller. The
notification mask is 0, ensuring that we won't get any notifications instead of
messages.
<4> The `operation` code distinguishes the operations we implement, so we
`match` on it.
<5> It's important to check `message_len`, since clients can send a message that
is too short or too long. Too-long messages get truncated, but `message_len`
will be honest, so if the `message_len` here were 6, we'd know the client sent a
truncated message.
<6> Clients can choose any operation code they want, so we need to make sure to
have a default case to signal errors.

== High-level (wrapper) implementation

The `userlib::hl` module provides wrappers for common patterns in server
implementation. Here's the same server from the last section, rewritten using
the `hl` conveniences.

[source,rust]
----
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use userlib::{hl, FromPrimitive}; // <1>
use zerocopy::AsBytes;

#[derive(FromPrimitive)]
enum Op { // <2>
    Add = 0,
    Sub = 1,
}

enum ResponseCode { // <3>
    // Note: code 1 is produced by hl
    BadArg = 2,
}

impl From<ResponseCode> for u32 { // <4>
    fn from(rc: ResponseCode) -> Self {
        rc as u32
    }
}

#[export_name = "main"]
pub fn main() -> ! {
    let mut the_integer: u32 = 0; // <5>

    let mut argument = 0u32; // <6>

    loop {
        hl::recv_without_notification( // <7>
            argument.as_bytes_mut(), // <8>
            |op, msg| -> Result<(), ResponseCode> { // <9>
                let (msg, caller) = msg.fixed::<u32, u32>() // <10>
                    .ok_or(ResponseCode::BadArg)?; // <11>

                match op { // <12>
                    Op::Add => the_integer.wrapping_add(argument),
                    Op::Sub => the_integer.wrapping_sub(argument),
                }

                caller.reply(the_integer); // <13>
                Ok(()) // <14>
            },
        );
    }
}
----

<1> The `userlib::hl` module provides these utilities for implementing clients
and servers, and is intended to be imported as `hl` like this, so references to
it in the file are prefixed with `hl::`. We also import the `FromPrimitive`
derive macro for our `Op` enum below.
<2> We now describe the possible operation codes using an enum. Any operation
outside this set will automatically generate an error reply to the client.
<3> Errors are still described in an enum, but `hl` directly supports this as
long as we provide a `From` impl for `u32`. We skip code 1 as it's used by `hl`
to indicate an illegal operation code.
<4> Here's our impl. It's unfortunate that Rust can't derive this, but, it
can't.
<5> Server state is still kept on the stack as a `u32`.
<6> This is our incoming argument buffer. Since all incoming messages use the
same argument type, `u32`, `hl` lets us use it directly instead of dealing in
byte arrays.
<7> `recv_without_notification` wraps up the open receive pattern used by most
servers.
<8> We pass the argument buffer in using `zerocopy::AsBytes`.
<9> This closure handles messages. The `op` parameter is automatically converted
to the `Op` enum by `hl`.
<10> The `fixed` operation requires that the argument exactly match the size of
its first type (here, `u32`), wrapping up the common case where arguments are
fixed-size.
<11> If we can't parse the message as a `u32` we bail with `BadArg`. `hl` is
designed so we can use `?` to signal errors here.
<12> And now, we `match` on the operation code. We no longer need a default
case, as `hl` has already filtered out unknown codes.
<13> The `caller` type returned from `fixed` has a convenient `reply` operation
that also checks that the types match.
<14> And, we're done.

== API wrapper crates

It's polite to provide a _wrapper crate_ that turns your server's IPC API into a
Rust API. We write these by hand at the moment, since we don't have any sort of
IDL. The general pattern is:

- Create a crate ending in `-api`, e.g. for the `fnord` service it would be
  `fnord-api` by convention.

- Implement a "server handle" type that wraps your server's `TaskId` and
  represents the server.

- Provide operations on that type that correspond to IPCs, or combinations of
  IPCs.

The wrapper crate should not depend on the server implementation crate. This may
require moving types around.

One of the decisions wrapper crates must make is how to handle server death --
that is, what if the server crashes while the client is talking to it, or
between messages? There are three common ways to respond.

1. Crash. If the client and server are engaged in some sort of stateful
protocol, the client may not be _able_ to recover from a server restart, and
want to restart itself in response. This effectively propagates the crash out
through a tree of dependent tasks, putting them all back in a known-good state.

2. Retry. If the request to the server is idempotent, the client may just want
to update their TaskId to the server's new generation and re-send. (That's what
the demo below does.)

3. Return an error. This lets the caller decide whether to retry. In practice, a
lot of callers will `unwrap` this error, which is a sign that the wrapper crate
should have chosen approach #1.

Here is a wrapper crate for the server presented earlier in this chapter,
expressed entirely using low-level Hubris API, under the assumption that we just
want to retry on server restart:

[source,rust]
----
#![no_std]

use abi::TaskId;
use core::cell::Cell;
use userlib::sys_send;
use zerocopy::AsBytes;

enum Op { // <1>
    Add = 0,
    Sub = 1,
}

pub struct IntServer(Cell<TaskId>); // <2>

impl IntServer {
    pub fn new(tid: TaskId) -> Self {
        Self(Cell::new(tid))
    }

    /// Adds `value` to the server's integer, returning the new
    /// integer.
    pub fn add(&self, value: u32) -> u32 {
        self.send(Op::Add, value)
    }

    /// Subtracts `value` to the server's integer, returning the
    /// new integer.
    pub fn sub(&self, value: u32) -> u32 {
        self.send(Op::Sub, value)
    }

    // Common implementation bit of add and sub, which
    // differ only in Op
    fn send(&self, op: Op, value: u32) -> u32 {
        let mut response = 0u32;
        loop { // <3>
            let target = self.0.get();
            let (code, response_len) = // <4>
                sys_send(target, op, value.as_bytes(), response.as_bytes_mut());

            if code == 0 && response_len == 4 {
                return response; // <5>
            } else if Some(g) = abi::extract_new_generation(code) {
                // The int server has crashed, let's just retry. // <6>
                self.0.set( // <7>
                    TaskId::for_index_and_gen(target.index(), g)
                );
            } else {
                panic!(); // <8>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This duplicates the `Op` enum from the server, and could be shared with some
rearranging.
<2> Clients will manipulate an `IntServer` as a sort of "handle" to the server,
hiding a `TaskId` that they need not concern themselves with.
<3> The send implementation is in a loop so that it can retry until it succeeds.
<4> Here we send a message to what we _believe_ is the right `TaskId`, though we
may find out otherwise shortly...
<5> A 0 return code means success -- the easy path.
<6> `abi::extract_new_generation` is a function for analyzing "dead codes"
received over IPC. If a result value indicates peer death, it will return
`Some(gen)` where `gen` is the peer's new generation number after restart.
<7> Here, we update our internal state to keep track of the correct server
generation.
<8> It may surprise you to see `panic!` here. More on this below.

Now, notice that the server can generate error codes, such as `BadArg` if the
buffers are the wrong size, but the client doesn't have any representation for
them. This is deliberate. In the case of the integer server protocol, _all_
potential errors returned from IPCs represent _programming errors_ in the
client:

- Use of an undefined operation code like 3 or 119,
- Sending a too-small or too-big message, or
- Providing the wrong size of response buffer.

In the first two cases the server will return a non-zero response code; in the
last case, it will succeed, but the `response_len` will show that our response
was truncated. Either case represents a mismatch between the wrapper crate and
the server, and the normal thing to do in such situations on Hubris is to
`panic!`.

== Pipelining

The server loop described above handles a single request at a time. Things
become more complex if the server wants to be able to handle multiple requests
concurrently. In that case, the _reply_ step is delayed until the work actually
completes, so the server may RECV another message before replying to the first.

For each incoming request, the server needs to record _at least_ the caller's
Task ID, so that it can respond. In practice, the server will also need to
record some details about each request, and some information about the state of
processing. While it's nice to pretend that we can resize buffers forever,
that's simply not the environment we work in. Eventually, the server's internal
storage for this sort of thing will fill up. At this point, the server should
finish at least one outstanding request before doing another RECV.

Typically, a pipelined server will keep information about outstanding requests
in a table. The maximum size of that table is dictated by the number of
potential clients. If the server has specific knowledge of this number in the
application, it can use that to size the table -- or it be conservative and set
the size of the table to `userlib::NUM_TASKS`, the number of tasks in the
system. Such a table should never overflow.

NOTE: Remember that tasks can restart -- any table tracking per-task state
should be indexed by task _index_ and record the generation. If a new request
arrives from the same task index but a different generation, the request should
be halted and replaced.
