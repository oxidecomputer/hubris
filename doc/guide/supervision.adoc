= Supervision

Rather than doing things like crash recovery in the kernel, Hubris assigns the
responsibility to a designated task, called the _supervisor._ This section
discusses the role of the supervisor and provides suggestions for writing your
own.

The Hubris repo contains our reference supervisor implementation, _El Jefe_, in
the `task-jefe` directory.

== What is the supervisor?

The supervisor is a task like any other. It is compiled with the application,
runs in the processor's unprivileged mode, and is subject to memory protection.

Two things make the supervisor different from other tasks:

1. It runs at the highest task priority, 0, and is the only task at this
priority.

2. The kernel recognizes it and interacts with it in unique ways.

The kernel can spot the supervisor because **the supervisor always has task
index 0,** and is listed first in the `app.toml`. The kernel treats task index 0
differently:

- When any _other_ task crashes, the kernel posts a notification to the
  supervisor task. This notification is always sent to bit 0 (i.e. the
  value `1`).

- The supervisor task is allowed to send any kernel IPC message.

- If the supervisor task crashes, **the system reboots.**

== What does the supervisor do?

The design of Hubris assumes that the supervisor is responsible for taking
action on task crashes. It may also do other things, but, that's the basics.

When any task crashes, the kernel will post a notification to the supervisor
task (as chosen by the `supervisor.notification` key in the `app.toml`). Since
notifications don't carry data payloads, this tells the supervisor that
_something_ has crashed, but not _what_ or _why_. The supervisor can use kernel
IPC messages to figure out the rest.

Currently, the supervisor needs to scan the set of tasks using the
`read_task_state` kernel IPC until it finds faults. (If the supervisor sometimes
lets tasks stay in faulted states, then it will need to keep track of that and
look for _new_ faults here.) It can then record that fault information somewhere
(maybe a log) and use the `reinit_task` call to fix the problem.

NOTE: Having to scan across the set of tasks is a little lame; if it proves to
be an issue in practice we'll introduce a more efficient way of pulling the last
crash(es) from the kernel via IPC.

The basic supervisor main loop reads, then, reads as follows:

[source,rust]
----
// Value chosen in app.toml.
const CRASH_NOTIFICATION: u32 = 1;

loop {
    // Closed receive will only accept notifications.
    let msg = sys_recv_closed(
        &mut [],
        CRASH_NOTIFICATION,
        TaskId::KERNEL,
    );

    // This case is so simple that we don't need to inspect
    // the message to distinguish different sources. See
    // below for a more complex example.

    // Scan tasks. Skip ourselves at index 0.
    for i in 1..hubris_num_tasks::NUM_TASKS {
        match userlib::kipc::read_task_status(i) {
            abi::TaskState::Faulted { fault, .. } => {
                // Record any observed faults and restart.
                log(fault);
                kipc::restart_task(i, true);
            }
        }
    }
}
----

(This is almost verbatim from the reference implementation.)

== Talking to the supervisor

A supervisor may expose an IPC interface that can be used by other tasks to
report information. (Because the supervisor is the highest priority task, any
task can SEND to it, but it is not allowed to SEND anywhere but the kernel.)

Why would you want to do this? Some examples might include:

- In a simple system, the supervisor might maintain the system's event log in a
  circular RAM buffer, and provide an IPC for other tasks to append information
  to it.

- You could implement interactive health monitoring (see next section).

- You could proxy kernel IPCs that are normally only available to the
  supervisor, optionally implementing restrictions or filters.

If the supervisor wishes to expose an IPC interface, its main loop changes as
follows:

[source,rust]
----
// Value chosen in app.toml.
const CRASH_NOTIFICATION: u32 = 1;

// However large our biggest incoming message will be.
const MAX_MSG: usize = 16;

loop {
    let mut msgbuf = [0u8; MAX_MSG]; // <1>
    let msg = sys_recv_open( // <2>
        &mut msgbuf,
        CRASH_NOTIFICATION,
    );

    if msg.sender == TaskId::KERNEL { // <3>
        // Scan tasks. Skip ourselves at index 0.
        for i in 1..hubris_num_tasks::NUM_TASKS {
            match userlib::kipc::read_task_status(i) {
                abi::TaskState::Faulted { fault, .. } => {
                    // Record any observed faults and restart.
                    log(fault);
                    kipc::restart_task(i, true);
                }
            }
        }
    } else {
        // This is a message from a task
        match msg.operation { // <4>
            ...
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The loop now needs a buffer for depositing incoming messages.
<2> Instead of a closed receive, we use an open receive to accept both
notifications and messages from any source.
<3> We need to distinguish notifications from messages by checking the origin.
<4> In the case of a message, we choose different actions based on the operation
code.
