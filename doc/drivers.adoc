= Writing drivers in hubris

One of the purposes of an operating system is to provide a driver abstraction
for talking to hardware. Most traditional monolithic kernels (e.g. Linux)
have applications making system calls (`read`, `write`, `ioctl`) directly
into the kernel where drivers live

```
        +-----------+   +-----------+   +-----------+
        |application|   |application|   |application|
        +-----------+   +-----------+   +-----------+
             |            |        |         |
             |            |        |         |
       +-------------------------------------------------+
             |            |        |         |
          +--v---+   +----v-+   +--v---+   +-v----+
          |driver|   |driver|   |driver|   |driver|
          +------+   +------+   +------+   +------+
```

Hubris is based on a microkernel architecture where drivers are unprivileged.
The primary communication method is `send` and `recv` between tasks. Hardware
drivers usually exist as a 'server' which listens for messages and changes
the hardware block accordingly. Multiple applications may call into a single
server.

```
             +-----------+  +-----------+  +-----------+
+------------+application|  |application|  |application+----------+
|            +--+------+-+  +----+------+  +---+-------+          |
|               |      |         |             |                  |
|              v+    v------------------v v----+                  |
|         +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+ +----------+        |
|         |server| |server| |server| |server| |supervisor|        |
|         +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+ +----------+        |

|                                                                 |
|         +----------------------------------------------+        |
|         |                                              |        |
+-------->+                  kernel                      +<-------+
          |                                              |
          +----------------------------------------------+
```

= High Level Access

In theory, each server can call `recv` and each application can call `send`
manually. To make life easier, these calls are wrapped via calls in the 
`userlib::hl` crate. These wrappers take care of typical error handling and
size validation. A typical server will look like


```
fn main() {
	turn_on_hardware_clocks();
	let B = get_hardware_block();

	B.clk.write(|w| w.clock.very_fast());

	B.cfg.modify(|_, w| w.foo.disable().
				enabled.set());

	let mask = 1;
	// Data we need during operation. None indicates no operation
	// in progress.
	let mut data: Option<BlockDat> = None;
	let mut buffer = [0; 1];

	loop {
		// This receives with notification, the alternate
		// version is hl::recv_without_notification
		hl::recv(
			// received buffer
			&mut buffer,
			// notifcation mask
			mask,
			// data
			&mut data,
			// Notification handler
			|dataref, bits| {
				if bits & 1 != 0 {
					// Matches our notification for an
					// interrupt, do something
					B.fifowr.write(|w| w.out.bits(buffer));
				}
			},
			// Message handler
			|dataref, op, msg| match op {
				Op::Write => {
					// Caller with 1 lease
					let ((), caller) =
                        			msg
						.fixed_with_leases(1)
						.ok_or(ResponseCode::BadArg)?

					// Deny incoming writes if we're
					// already running one.
                    			if dataref.is_some() {
                        			return Err(ResponseCode::Busy);
                    			}

					// Our lease #0 is what is being sent to
					// the hardware
					let borrow = caller.borrow(0);
                    			let info = borrow.info()
						.ok_or(ResponseCode::BadArg)?;
                    			// Provide feedback to callers if they
					// fail to provide a readable lease
					// (otherwise we'd fail accessing the
					// borrow later, which is a defection
					// case and we won't reply at all).
                    			if !info.attributes.contains(LeaseAttributes::READ) {
                        			return Err(ResponseCode::BadArg);
                    			}

					*dataref = Some(Data {
						task: caller,
						pos: 0,
						len: info.len
					});

					B.intstat.write(|w| w.interrupt_en.set());
					Ok(())
				}
				Op::Read => {
					// Looks almost identical to Write except
					// We check the borrow against
					// LeaseAttributes::WRITE

				}	
			},
		);
	}

}
```

= Driver API crates

In a similar manner to `send` and `recv` for driver servers, the servers
themselves may provide wrappers for the benefit of clients. This is
especially helpful for drivers which may rely on magic numbers for
setting hardware. If a driver is name `drv-abc123-foo` the API crate
is typically named `drv-abc123-foo-api`. An example API might look like:

```

enum Op {
	Write,
	Read,
	Reset,
}

enum Peripheral {
	Alpha,
	Bravo,
	Charlie,
	Delta,
	Echo,
	Foxtrot	
}

pub struct Data(TaskId);

impl Data {
	pub fn write(&self, peripheral: Peripheral, entry: u32) {
		struct WriteData(Peripheral, u32);

		impl hl::Call for WriteData {
			const OP: u16 = Op::Write as u16;
			// We don't expect a meaningful response.
			type Response = ();
			// Error is just an int
			type Err = u32;
		}

		hl::send(self.0, &WriteData(peripheral, entry));
	}
}
```
