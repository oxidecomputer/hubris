//! User application support library for Hubris.
//!
//! This contains syscall stubs and types, and re-exports the contents of the
//! `abi` crate that gets shared with the kernel.
//!
//! # Syscall stub implementations
//!
//! Each syscall stub consists of two parts: a public `sys_foo` function
//! intended for use by programs, and an internal `sys_foo_stub` function. This
//! might seem like needless duplication, and in a way, it is.
//!
//! Limitations in the behavior of the current `asm!` feature mean we have a
//! hard time moving values into registers r6, r7, and r11. Because (for better
//! or worse) the syscall ABI uses these registers, we have to take extra steps.
//!
//! The `stub` function contains the actual `asm!` call sequence. It is `naked`,
//! meaning the compiler will *not* attempt to do any framepointer/basepointer
//! nonsense, and we can thus reason about the assignment and availability of
//! all registers.
//!
//! See: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73450#issuecomment-650463347
