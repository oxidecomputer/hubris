/// This is a wrapper for the `sys_recv` syscall that takes care of paperwork on
/// your behalf.
///
/// `buffer` should be large enough to contain the largest valid message that
/// can be sent to your task.
///
/// `mask` is a bitmask describing the set of notifications to accept. Bits set
/// (1) in this mask indicate that a notification is allowed.
///
/// `state` is a value of your choice that will get passed to whichever closure
/// -- `notify` or `msg` -- gets executed. More on this below.
///
/// `notify` will be called if the kernel provides a notification instead of a
/// message. Its only parameter: a `u32` with a bit set for each pending
/// notification.
///
/// `msg` will be called if the kernel provides a proper message from another
/// task. It will be passed: the `state`, the decoded operation, and a `Message`
/// describing the contents.
///
/// # About operation decoding
///
/// `hl::recv` operates on a type, `O`, that you choose. This represents the
/// operation code, and must implement `FromPrimitive` so we can try to make an
/// `O` from a `u32`.
///
/// Whenever a message (not a notification) arrives, we'll attempt to make an
/// `O` out of its operation code using `FromPrimitive::from_u32`. If this
/// succeeds, we pass the result into your `msg` closure.
///
/// If it *fails*, we immediately respond to the caller with an error code (1)
/// that has conventionally come to mean "bad operation."
///
/// # About error encoding
///
/// Your `msg` closure can return an error type, `E`. If this occurs, `recv`
/// will convert it into a `u32` and send it back to the caller as the response
/// code to the IPC.
///
/// Because the response code 0 means "success," your error type `E` should not
/// have a value corresponding to 0, or things will get weird for you.
///
/// # About the `state` parameter
///
/// If `recv` took only one closure, it could borrow exclusively (`&mut`)
/// anything it wanted from the caller's stack frame, and your life would be
/// simple and easy. (For one way of achieving a simple and easy life, see
/// `recv_without_notification`.)
///
/// However, `recv` takes *two* closures. If both of these closures need access
/// to the same mutable state in your server's stack frame -- and they almost
/// certainly do! -- the compiler will complain when they both try to borrow it.
///
/// To fix this, don't borrow it in the closures -- borrow it and pass it as
/// `state`. It will be provided to whichever closure is executed, as its first
/// argument.
///
/// If you don't need this, just pass `()`.
