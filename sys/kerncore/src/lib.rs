/// contiguous region. The task's memory access permissions are described by
/// `table`, which is an array of region descriptors.
///
/// The exact implementation of both the slice type `S` and the region type `R`
/// are left unspecified here, to avoid needing to rely on kernel-internal
/// types. The requirements for each type are specified by [`UserSlice`] and
/// [`MemoryRegion`], respectively.
///
/// Generally speaking, not all task region descriptors confer the same rights
/// --- some are read-only, some may represent an address space hole that cannot
/// be accessed, etc. To reflect this, this routine takes a `region_ok`
/// predicate over the `R` type. Provide a `region_ok` function to do any access
/// permission checking that you require.
///
/// # Preconditions
///
/// `table` must be sorted by region base address, and the regions in the table
/// must not overlap.
///
/// Both `slice` and each element of `table` must meet the properties described
/// on [`UserSlice`] and [`MemoryRegion`], respectively.

/// # Returns
///
/// `true` if `slice` is completely covered by one or more regions in `table`
/// that meet the `region_ok` condition.
