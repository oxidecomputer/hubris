//! Kernel online profiling support.
//!
//! This is intended to help measure the timing of kernel events, duration of
//! syscalls, and the like, as an aid to debugging or optimization work.
//!
//! Because the kernel is SoC-independent, this module does not assume any
//! particular way of getting profiling information out of the kernel. Instead,
//! any target that wants to use profiling needs to populate an `EventsTable`
//! struct and provide it to `kern::profiling::configure_events_table` from its
//! startup routine. This requires the target to provide functions for a set of
//! _events._ The currently defined events are listed in the docs for
//! `EventsTable`.
//!
//! A typical implementation would implement these event handling functions by
//! setting or clearing GPIOs on the processor package, where they can be
//! monitored and examined by an external logic analyzer. Other implementations
//! are of course possible, but be careful of probe effect and keep the handler
//! functions fast.
