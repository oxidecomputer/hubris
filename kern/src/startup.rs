//! Kernel startup.

/// The main kernel entry point.
///
/// We currently expect an application to provide its own `main`-equivalent
/// function, which does basic hardware setup and then calls this function with
/// the location of the `App` header and some kernel-dedicated RAM.
///
/// Parameters:
///
/// - `app_header_ptr` is the address of the application header, found through
///   whatever eldritch magic you choose (probably a linker symbol).
/// - `scratch_ram` and `scratch_ram_size` are the base and extent of a section
///   of bytes that the kernel will use for its own purposes. Its required size
///   depends on the number of tasks you allocate. (TODO: we should give more
///   guidance than that.) It's important for correctness that this *not* be
///   accessible to any task.
/// - `tick_divisor`: a platform-specific way of converting "machine ticks" into
///   "kernel ticks." On ARM M-profile, this is CPU cycles per tick, where a
///   tick is typically a millisecond.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This can be called exactly once per boot, with valid pointers that don't
/// alias any other structure or one another.
