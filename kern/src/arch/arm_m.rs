//! Architecture support for ARMv{7,8}-M.
//!
//! Mostly ARMv7-M at the moment.
//!
//! # ARM-M timer
//!
//! We use the system tick timer as the kernel timer, but it's only suitable for
//! producing periodic interrupts -- its counter is small and only counts down.
//! So, at each interrupt, we increment the `TICKS` global that contains the
//! real kernel timestamp. This has the downside that we take regular interrupts
//! to maintain `TICKS`, but has the upside that we don't need special SoC
//! support for timing.
//!
//! # Notes on ARM-M interrupts
//!
//! For performance and (believe it or not) simplicity, this implementation uses
//! several different interrupt service routines:
//!
//! - `SVCall` implements the `SVC` instruction used to make syscalls.
//! - `SysTick` handles interrupts from the System Tick Timer, used to maintain
//! the kernel timestamp.
//! - `PendSV` handles deferred context switches from interrupts.
//!
//! The first two are expected; the last one's a bit odd and deserves an
//! explanation.
//!
//! It has to do with interrupt latency.
//!
//! On any interrupt, the processor stacks a small subset of machine state and
//! then calls our ISR. Our ISR is a normal Rust function, and follows the
//! normal (C) calling convention: there are some registers that it can use
//! without saving, and there are others it must save first. When the ISR
//! returns, it restores any registers it saved.
//!
//! This is great, as long as the code you're returning to is the *same code
//! that called you* -- but in the case of a context switch, it isn't.
//!
//! There's another problem, which is that we'd like to be able to read the
//! values of some of the user registers for syscall arguments and the like...
//! but if we rely on the automatic saving to put them somewhere on the stack,
//! that "somewhere" is opaque and we can't manipulate it.
//!
//! And so, if you want to be able to inspect callee registers (beyond `r0`
//! through `r3`) or switch tasks, you need to do something more elaborate than
//! the basic hardware interrupt behavior: you need to carefully deposit all
//! user state into the `Task`, and then read it back on the way out (possibly
//! from a different `Task` if the context has switched).
//!
//! This is relatively costly, so it's only appropriate to do this in an ISR
//! that you believe will result in a context switch. `SVCall` usually does --
//! our most-used system calls are blocking. `SysTick` usually *does not* -- it
//! will cause a context switch only when it causes a higher-priority timer to
//! fire, which is a sometimes thing. And most hardware interrupt handlers are
//! also not guaranteed to cause a context switch immediately.
//!
//! So, we do the full save/restore sequence around `SVCall` (see the assembly
//! code in that function), but *not* around `SysTick`, and not around other
//! hardware IRQs. Instead, if one of those routines discovers that a context
//! switch is required, it pokes a register that sets the `PendSV` interrupt
//! pending.
//!
//! `PendSV` is intended for this exact use. It will kick in when our ISR exits
//! (i.e. it won't preempt our ISR, but follow it) and perform the full
//! save/restore sequence around invoking the scheduler.
//!
//! We didn't invent this idea -- it's covered in most books on the Cortex-M.
//! We might later decide that most ISRs (including ticks) tend to trigger
//! context switches, and just always do full save/restore, eliminating PendSV.
//! We'll see.
