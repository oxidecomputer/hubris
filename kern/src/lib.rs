//! Hubris kernel model.
//!
//! This code is intended to lay out the design concepts for the Hubris kernel
//! implementation and make some points about algorithm implementation. It may
//! evolve to become the actual kernel, or it may not.
//!
//! Currently, this is intended to be portable to both ARM and x86, for testing
//! and simulation purposes.
//!
//! # Algorithm Naivety Principles
//!
//! This implementation uses *really naive algorithms*. This is deliberate. The
//! intent is:
//!
//! 1. To use safe Rust for as much as possible.
//! 2. To use easily understood and debugged algorithms.
//! 3. To revisit these decisions if they become performance problems.
//!
//! Assumptions enabling our naivete:
//!
//! - The total number of tasks is fixed (in a given build) and small. Say, less
//!   than 200.
//! - We are not attempting to achieve predictably low worst-case execution
//!   bounds or any realtime nonsense like that.
